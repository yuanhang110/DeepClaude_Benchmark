#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in food_chain.py to resolve the errors.  

I'll help you fix the `food_chain.py` file to implement the song generation logic. The strategy is to define the animals and their properties, then build the verses dynamically based on the predator-prey relationships.

This implementation:

1. Defines a list of animals with their properties:
   - name: The animal's name
   - intro_comment: The comment line after introducing the animal
   - chain_suffix: Additional text added when this animal is caught by another (specifically for the spider's "wriggled and jiggled" part)

2. For each verse number:
   - Handles verse 8 (horse) as a special case with just two lines
   - For other verses:
     - Adds the intro line "I know an old lady..."
     - Adds the animal's intro comment if it exists
     - Builds the chain of animals by working backwards from current animal to fly
     - Adds the standard fly ending line

3. Joins all verses together with empty lines between them

The code should now pass all the test cases, correctly generating each verse of the song with proper formatting and predator-prey relationships.
