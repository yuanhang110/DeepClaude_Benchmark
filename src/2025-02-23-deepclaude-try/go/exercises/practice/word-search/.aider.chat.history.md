#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific words in them.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### jefblpepre  
#### camdcimgtc  
#### oivokprjsm  
#### pbwasqroua  
#### rixilelhrs  
#### wolcqlirpc  
#### screeaumgr  
#### alxhpburyi  
#### jalaycalmp  
#### clojurermt  
#### ```  
####   
#### There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.  
####   
#### Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.  
####   
#### Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last letter of each word.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word_search.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the word search solution in Go. Based on the provided reasoning, we need to implement a solver that can find words in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and return their start and end positions.



word_search.go
```go

package wordsearch

func Solve(words []string, puzzle []string) (map[string][2][2]int, error) {
	panic("Please implement the Solve function")
}
=======
package wordsearch

import "fmt"

func Solve(words []string, puzzle []string) (map[string][2][2]int, error) {
	results := make(map[string][2][2]int)
	directions := []struct{ dx, dy int }{
		{1, 0},  // right
		{-1, 0}, // left
		{0, 1},  // down
		{0, -1}, // up
		{1, 1},  // down-right
		{-1, 1}, // down-left
		{1, -1}, // up-right
		{-1, -1}, // up-left
	}

	// Check for empty puzzle
	if len(puzzle) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("empty puzzle")
	}
	rows, cols := len(puzzle), len(puzzle[0])

	for _, word := range words {
		if len(word) == 0 {
			continue
		}
		found := false
		wordLength := len(word)

	WordSearch:
		for y := 0; y < rows; y++ {
			for x := 0; x < cols; x++ {
				for _, dir := range directions {
					// Calculate end position for current direction
					endX := x + (wordLength-1)*dir.dx
					endY := y + (wordLength-1)*dir.dy

					// Skip if word won't fit in this direction
					if endX < 0 || endX >= cols || endY < 0 || endY >= rows {
						continue
					}

					// Check each character
					matched := true
					for i := 0; i < wordLength; i++ {
						currX := x + i*dir.dx
						currY := y + i*dir.dy
						if puzzle[currY][currX] != word[i] {
							matched = false
							break
						}
					}

					if matched {
						results[word] = [2][2]int{{x, y}, {endX, endY}}
						found = true
						break WordSearch
					}
				}
			}
		}

		if !found {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("word '%s' not found", word)
		}
	}

	return results, nil
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
2. For each word:
   - Tries every starting position in the grid
   - For each position, tries all 8 directions
   - Checks if the word fits in bounds before attempting to match
   - Returns coordinates of first and last letter when found
3. Returns an error if:
   - The puzzle is empty
   - Any word is not found
4. Handles empty words by skipping them
5. Uses efficient breaking from nested loops using labels
6. Assumes the puzzle is rectangular (all rows same length) as specified

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
