#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.  
####   
#### Note that not all verses are identical.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.  
#### ```

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bottle_song.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the Ten Green Bottles song in Go. Let me create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to modify the bottle_song.go file with the implementation.




```go 
package bottlesong

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string {
	numberWords := map[int]string{
		1:  "One",
		2:  "Two",
		3:  "Three",
		4:  "Four",
		5:  "Five",
		6:  "Six",
		7:  "Seven",
		8:  "Eight",
		9:  "Nine",
		10: "Ten",
	}

	var verses []string

	for i := 0; i < takeDown; i++ {
		current := startBottles - i
		next := current - 1

		currentWord := numberWords[current]
		currentBottles := "bottles"
		if current == 1 {
			currentBottles = "bottle"
		}

		line1 := fmt.Sprintf("%s green %s hanging on the wall,", currentWord, currentBottles)
		line2 := line1
		line3 := "And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,"

		var line4 string
		if next == 0 {
			line4 = "There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall."
		} else {
			nextWord := strings.ToLower(numberWords[next])
			nextBottles := "bottles"
			if next == 1 {
				nextBottles = "bottle"
			}
			line4 = fmt.Sprintf("There'll be %s green %s hanging on the wall.", nextWord, nextBottles)
		}

		verses = append(verses, line1, line2, line3, line4)

		if i < takeDown-1 {
			verses = append(verses, "")
		}
	}

	return verses
}

```


Let me provide a SEARCH/REPLACE block to update the file:

bottle_song.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package bottlesong

func Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string {
	panic("Please implement the Recite function")
}
=======
package bottlesong

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func Recite(startBottles, takeDown int) []string {
	numberWords := map[int]string{
		1:  "One",
		2:  "Two",
		3:  "Three",
		4:  "Four",
		5:  "Five",
		6:  "Six",
		7:  "Seven",
		8:  "Eight",
		9:  "Nine",
		10: "Ten",
	}

	var verses []string

	for i := 0; i < takeDown; i++ {
		current := startBottles - i
		next := current - 1

		currentWord := numberWords[current]
		currentBottles := "bottles"
		if current == 1 {
			currentBottles = "bottle"
		}

		line1 := fmt.Sprintf("%s green %s hanging on the wall,", currentWord, currentBottles)
		line2 := line1
		line3 := "And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,"

		var line4 string
		if next == 0 {
			line4 = "There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall."
		} else {
			nextWord := strings.ToLower(numberWords[next])
			nextBottles := "bottles"
			if next == 1 {
				nextBottles = "bottle"
			}
			line4 = fmt.Sprintf("There'll be %s green %s hanging on the wall.", nextWord, nextBottles)
		}

		verses = append(verses, line1, line2, line3, line4)

		if i < takeDown-1 {
			verses = append(verses, "")
		}
	}

	return verses
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Converts numbers to words using a map
2. Handles singular/plural forms correctly ("bottle" vs "bottles")
3. Generates each verse with proper formatting
4. Adds blank lines between verses except after the last verse
5. Uses proper capitalization (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)
6. Handles the special case when next count is zero ("no green bottles")

The code follows the exact format of the example lyrics provided. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
