#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Write a robot simulator.  
####   
#### A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.  
####   
#### The robots have three possible movements:  
####   
#### - turn right  
#### - turn left  
#### - advance  
####   
#### Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,  
#### e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.  
####   
#### The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which direction it is pointing.  
####   
#### - The letter-string "RAALAL" means:  
####   - Turn right  
####   - Advance twice  
####   - Turn left  
####   - Advance once  
####   - Turn left yet again  
#### - Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north.  
####   Then running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Implementation Notes  
####   
#### Tests are separated into 3 steps.  
####   
#### Run all tests with `go test` or run specific tests with the -tags option.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### ```bash  
#### go test                      # run all tests  
#### go test -tags step1          # run just step 1 tests.  
#### go test -tags 'step1 step2'  # run step1 and step2 tests  
#### ```  
####   
#### You are given the source file defs.go which defines a number of things  
#### the test program requires.  It is organized into three sections by step.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### To complete step 1 you will define Right, Left, Advance, N, S, E, W,  
#### and Dir.String.  Complete step 1 before moving on to step 2.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### For step 1 you implemented robot movements, but it's not much of a simulation.  
#### For example where in the source code is "the robot"?  Where is "the grid"?  
#### Where are the computations that turn robot actions into grid positions,  
#### in the robot, or in the grid?  The physical world is different.  
####   
#### Step 2 introduces a "room."  It seems a small addition, but we'll make  
#### big changes to clarify the roles of "room", "robot", and "test program"  
#### and begin to clarify the physics of the simulation.  You will define Room  
#### and Robot as functions which the test program "brings into existence" by  
#### launching them as goroutines.  Information moves between test program,  
#### robot, and room over Go channels.  
####   
#### Think of Room as a "physics engine," something that models and simulates  
#### a physical room with walls and a robot.  It should somehow model the  
#### coordinate space of the room, the location of the robot and the walls,  
#### and ensure for example that the robot doesn't walk through walls.  
#### We want Robot to be an agent that performs actions, but we want Room to  
#### maintain a coherent truth.  
####   
#### The test program creates the channels and starts both Room and Robot.  
#### The test program then sends commands to Robot.  When it is done sending  
#### commands, it closes the command channel.  Robot must accept commands and  
#### inform Room of actions it is attempting.  When it senses the command channel  
#### closing, it must shut itself down.  The room must interpret the physical  
#### consequences of the robot actions.  When it senses the robot shutting down,  
#### it sends a final report back to the test program, telling the robot's final  
#### position and direction.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Step 3 has three major changes:  
####   
#### *  Robots run scripts rather than respond to individual commands.  
#### *  A log channel allows robots and the room to log messages.  
#### *  The room allows multiple robots to exist and operate concurrently.  
####   
#### For the final position report sent from Room3, you can return the same slice  
#### received from the robots channel, just with updated positions and directions.  
####   
#### Messages must be sent on the log channel for  
#### *  A robot without a name  
#### *  Duplicate robot names  
#### *  Robots placed at the same place  
#### *  A robot placed outside of the room  
#### *  An undefined command in a script  
#### *  An action from an unknown robot  
#### *  A robot attempting to advance into a wall  
#### *  A robot attempting to advance into another robot  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot_simulator.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the robot simulator step by step. Here are the necessary changes to robot_simulator.go:

First, let's add the import and constants for Step 1:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package robot

// See defs.go for other definitions
=======
package robot

import "fmt"

// See defs.go for other definitions

var (
    currentDir Dir
    posX, posY int
)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now implement the direction constants and movement functions for Step 1:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Step 1
// Define N, E, S, W here.

func Right() {
	panic("Please implement the Right function")
}
=======
// Step 1
// Define N, E, S, W here.
const (
    N Dir = iota
    E
    S
    W
)

func Right() {
    currentDir = (currentDir + 1) % 4
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Implement Left function:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func Left() {
	panic("Please implement the Left function")
}
=======
func Left() {
    currentDir = (currentDir - 1 + 4) % 4
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Implement Advance function:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func Advance() {
	panic("Please implement the Advance function")
}
=======
func Advance() {
    switch currentDir {
    case N:
        posY++
    case E:
        posX++
    case S:
        posY--
    case W:
        posX--
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Implement String method:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func (d Dir) String() string {
	panic("Please implement the String function")
}
=======
func (d Dir) String() string {
    return [...]string{"N", "E", "S", "W"}[d]
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

For Step 2, let's define the Action type and implement StartRobot:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Step 2
// Define Action type here.

func StartRobot(command chan Command, action chan Action) {
	panic("Please implement the StartRobot function")
}
=======
// Step 2
// Define Action type here.
type Action int

const (
    RightAction Action = iota
    LeftAction
    AdvanceAction
)

func StartRobot(command chan Command, action chan Action) {
    for cmd := range command {
        switch cmd {
        case 'R':
            action <- RightAction
        case 'L':
            action <- LeftAction
        case 'A':
            action <- AdvanceAction
        }
    }
    close(action)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Implement Room function:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func Room(extent Rect, robot Step2Robot, action chan Action, report chan Step2Robot) {
	panic("Please implement the Room function")
}
=======
func Room(extent Rect, robot Step2Robot, action chan Action, report chan Step2Robot) {
    pos := robot.Pos
    dir := robot.Dir

    for act := range action {
        switch act {
        case RightAction:
            dir = (dir + 1) % 4
        case LeftAction:
            dir = (dir - 1 + 4) % 4
        case AdvanceAction:
            newPos := pos
            switch dir {
            case N:
                newPos.Y++
            case E:
                newPos.X++
            case S:
                newPos.Y--
            case W:
                newPos.X--
            }
            if newPos.X >= extent.Min.X && newPos.X <= extent.Max.X &&
                newPos.Y >= extent.Min.Y && newPos.Y <= extent.Max.Y {
                pos = newPos
            }
        }
    }

    report <- Step2Robot{Pos: pos, Dir: dir}
    close(report)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, for Step 3, implement the Action3 type and related functions:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Step 3
// Define Action3 type here.

func StartRobot3(name, script string, action chan Action3, log chan string) {
	panic("Please implement the StartRobot3 function")
}

func Room3(extent Rect, robots []Step3Robot, action chan Action3, rep chan []Step3Robot, log chan string) {
	panic("Please implement the Room3 function")
}
=======
// Step 3
// Define Action3 type here.
type Action3 struct {
    Name   string
    Action Action
}

func StartRobot3(name, script string, action chan Action3, log chan string) {
    if name == "" {
        log <- "Robot has no name"
        return
    }
    for _, c := range script {
        var act Action
        switch c {
        case 'R':
            act = RightAction
        case 'L':
            act = LeftAction
        case 'A':
            act = AdvanceAction
        default:
            log <- "Undefined command: " + string(c)
            return
        }
        action <- Action3{Name: name, Action: act}
    }
    close(action)
}

func Room3(extent Rect, robots []Step3Robot, action chan Action3, rep chan []Step3Robot, log chan string) {
    robotMap := make(map[string]*Step3Robot)
    posMap := make(map[Vec2D]string)

    // Initial placement
    for _, r := range robots {
        if r.Name == "" {
            log <- "Robot has no name"
            continue
        }
        if _, exists := robotMap[r.Name]; exists {
            log <- "Duplicate robot name: " + r.Name
            continue
        }
        if r.Pos.X < extent.Min.X || r.Pos.X > extent.Max.X ||
            r.Pos.Y < extent.Min.Y || r.Pos.Y > extent.Max.Y {
            log <- "Robot placed outside room: " + r.Name
            continue
        }
        if other, exists := posMap[r.Pos]; exists {
            log <- fmt.Sprintf("Robot %s placed at same position as %s", r.Name, other)
            continue
        }

        robotMap[r.Name] = &Step3Robot{Name: r.Name, Pos: r.Pos, Dir: r.Dir}
        posMap[r.Pos] = r.Name
    }

    // Process actions
    for a := range action {
        r, exists := robotMap[a.Name]
        if !exists {
            log <- "Action from unknown robot: " + a.Name
            continue
        }

        switch a.Action {
        case RightAction:
            r.Dir = (r.Dir + 1) % 4
        case LeftAction:
            r.Dir = (r.Dir - 1 + 4) % 4
        case AdvanceAction:
            newPos := r.Pos
            switch r.Dir {
            case N:
                newPos.Y++
            case E:
                newPos.X++
            case S:
                newPos.Y--
            case W:
                newPos.X--
            }

            // Check room boundaries
            if newPos.X < extent.Min.X || newPos.X > extent.Max.X ||
                newPos.Y < extent.Min.Y || newPos.Y > extent.Max.Y {
                log <- fmt.Sprintf("Robot %s attempted to move into wall", a.Name)
                continue
            }

            // Check for other robots
            if other, exists := posMap[newPos]; exists {
                log <- fmt.Sprintf("Robot %s attempted to move into %s", a.Name, other)
                continue
            }

            // Update position
            delete(posMap, r.Pos)
            r.Pos = newPos
            posMap[newPos] = a.Name
        }
    }

    // Prepare report
    var result []Step3Robot
    for _, r := range robotMap {
        result = append(result, *r)
    }
    rep <- result
    close(rep)
    close(log)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes implement all three steps of the robot simulator:
1. Basic robot movement with direction tracking
2. Single robot in a room with boundaries
3. Multiple robots with collision detection and logging

The implementation handles all the requirements including:
- Direction constants and movement functions
- Room boundaries and movement validation
- Multiple robot coordination
- Error logging for various scenarios
- Concurrent operation using channels

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail?

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in robot_simulator.go to resolve the errors.  

Based on the test errors and analysis, I'll create SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix the field name issues in the Room function. The problem is that the Pos struct has lowercase field names (x, y) but the code is trying to use uppercase (X, Y).

Let's fix each occurrence:

robot_simulator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            case N:
                newPos.Y++
            case E:
                newPos.X++
            case S:
                newPos.Y--
            case W:
                newPos.X--
            }
            if newPos.X >= extent.Min.X && newPos.X <= extent.Max.X &&
                newPos.Y >= extent.Min.Y && newPos.Y <= extent.Max.Y {
=======
            case N:
                newPos.y++
            case E:
                newPos.x++
            case S:
                newPos.y--
            case W:
                newPos.x--
            }
            if newPos.x >= extent.Min.x && newPos.x <= extent.Max.x &&
                newPos.y >= extent.Min.y && newPos.y <= extent.Max.y {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces all uppercase X/Y field accesses with lowercase x/y in the Room function, which should match the actual field names in the Pos struct defined in defs.go. 

The key fix is:
1. Changed all newPos.X/Y to newPos.x/y
2. Changed all extent.Min.X/Y to extent.Min.x/y 
3. Changed all extent.Max.X/Y to extent.Max.x/y

This should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the same functionality.
