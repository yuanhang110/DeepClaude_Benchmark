#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.  
####   
#### There are some rules that your solution must follow:  
####   
#### - You can only do one action at a time.  
#### - There are only 3 possible actions:  
####   1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:  
####      a) the first bucket is empty  
####      b) the second bucket is full  
####   2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
####   3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
#### - After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.  
####   
#### Your program will take as input:  
####   
#### - the size of bucket one  
#### - the size of bucket two  
#### - the desired number of liters to reach  
#### - which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two  
####   
#### Your program should determine:  
####   
#### - the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket  
#### - which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two  
#### - how many liters are left in the other bucket  
####   
#### Note: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.  
####   
#### Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.  
#### Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).  
#### If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.  
#### Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.  
####   
#### Another Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.  
#### You are told you must start with bucket one.  
#### So your first action is to fill bucket one.  
#### You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.  
#### For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.

#### # Implementation  
####   
#### In package twobucket, implement a Go func, Solve, with  
#### the following signature:  
####   
#### ```  
#### func Solve(sizeBucketOne,  
#### 	sizeBucketTwo,  
#### 	goalAmount int,  
#### 	startBucket string) (goalBucket string, numSteps, otherBucketLevel int, e error)  
#### ```  
#### Solve returns four values: the resulting goal bucket("one" or two"),  
#### the number of moves/steps to achieve the goal amount,  
#### the liters left in the other bucket, and an error value.  
#### The returned error value should be nil when the parameters are valid.  
#### Return an error for any invalid parameter.  
#### Solve should also return an error when a solution cannot be found,  
#### but this error relates only to the bonus exercise below, so you may  
#### ignore that error case for your initial solution.  
####   
#### ## Bonus exercise  
####   
#### Once you get `go test` passing, try `go test -tags bonus`.  This uses a *build  
#### tag* to enable tests that were not previously enabled. Build tags control which  
#### files should be included in the package. You can read more about those at [the  
#### Go documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints).  
####   
#### The exercise limits `go test` to only build the tests referenced in the  
#### `two_bucket_test.go` file. The bonus test cases are found in the file  
#### `bonus_test.go`. Enable those tests as described above.  
####   
#### To get the bonus tests to pass, the Solve func must detect when  
#### a solution cannot be found and return an error.  
#### A solution cannot be found when input test case bucket sizes  
#### are not ones which allow the three operations to succeed in creating the goal amount,  
#### which occurs when the two bucket sizes are not relatively prime to one another.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two_bucket.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the solution for the two bucket problem. Based on the problem description and requirements, here's the updated code:

package twobucket

import "fmt"

func Solve(sizeBucketOne, sizeBucketTwo, goalAmount int, startBucket string) (string, int, int, error) {
	// Check for invalid parameters
	if sizeBucketOne <= 0 || sizeBucketTwo <= 0 || goalAmount <= 0 {
		return "", 0, 0, fmt.Errorf("invalid bucket sizes or goal amount")
	}
	if startBucket != "one" && startBucket != "two" {
		return "", 0, 0, fmt.Errorf("invalid start bucket")
	}
	if goalAmount > sizeBucketOne && goalAmount > sizeBucketTwo {
		return "", 0, 0, fmt.Errorf("goal is larger than both buckets")
	}

	// Check if GCD of bucket sizes doesn't divide goal (bonus requirement)
	d := gcd(sizeBucketOne, sizeBucketTwo)
	if goalAmount%d != 0 {
		return "", 0, 0, fmt.Errorf("no solution exists")
	}

	// Determine initial state based on start bucket
	var initialB1, initialB2 int
	if startBucket == "one" {
		initialB1 = sizeBucketOne
		initialB2 = 0
		if initialB1 == goalAmount {
			return "one", 1, 0, nil
		}
	} else {
		initialB1 = 0
		initialB2 = sizeBucketTwo
		if initialB2 == goalAmount {
			return "two", 1, 0, nil
		}
	}

	// Initialize BFS
	visited := make(map[[2]int]bool)
	queue := [][3]int{{initialB1, initialB2, 1}}
	visited[[2]int{initialB1, initialB2}] = true

	for len(queue) > 0 {
		current := queue[0]
		queue = queue[1:]

		// Generate all possible next states
		nextStates := make([][3]int, 0)

		// Fill bucket 1
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{sizeBucketOne, current[1], current[2] + 1})

		// Fill bucket 2
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{current[0], sizeBucketTwo, current[2] + 1})

		// Empty bucket 1
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{0, current[1], current[2] + 1})

		// Empty bucket 2
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{current[0], 0, current[2] + 1})

		// Pour from 1 to 2
		pour := min(current[0], sizeBucketTwo-current[1])
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{current[0] - pour, current[1] + pour, current[2] + 1})

		// Pour from 2 to 1
		pour = min(current[1], sizeBucketOne-current[0])
		nextStates = append(nextStates, [3]int{current[0] + pour, current[1] - pour, current[2] + 1})

		// Process each next state
		for _, ns := range nextStates {
			stateKey := [2]int{ns[0], ns[1]}
			if visited[stateKey] {
				continue
			}

			// Check if the state violates the post-action rule
			if startBucket == "one" {
				if ns[0] == 0 && ns[1] == sizeBucketTwo {

				}
			} else {
				if ns[1] == 0 && ns[0] == sizeBucketOne {

			// Check if goal is met in this state

				return "two", ns[2], ns[0], nil
			}

			// Add to visited and queue
			visited[stateKey] = true
			queue = append(queue, ns)
		}
	}

	// If no solution found
	return "", 0, 0, fmt.Errorf("no solution exists")
}

func gcd(a, b int) int {
	for b != 0 {
		a, b = b, a%b
	}
	return a
}

func min(a, b int) int {
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}

```

This implementation:

1. Validates input parameters and returns appropriate errors for invalid inputs
2. Uses a BFS approach to find the minimum number of steps required
3. Implements the three possible actions: filling, emptying, and pouring between buckets
4. Tracks visited states to avoid cycles
5. Enforces the rule about not reaching a state where the starting bucket is empty and the other is full
6. Includes the GCD check for the bonus requirement to detect unsolvable cases
7. Returns the required information: which bucket contains the goal amount, number of steps taken, and amount in the other bucket

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
