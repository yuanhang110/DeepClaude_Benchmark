#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 0 — Numbers  
####   
#### Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.  
####   
#### > What is 5?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 5.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 1 — Addition  
####   
#### Add two numbers together.  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 18.  
####   
#### Handle large numbers and negative numbers.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division  
####   
#### Now, perform the other three operations.  
####   
#### > What is 7 minus 5?  
####   
#### 2  
####   
#### > What is 6 multiplied by 4?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 25 divided by 5?  
####   
#### 5  
####   
#### ## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations  
####   
#### Handle a set of operations, in sequence.  
####   
#### Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?  
####   
#### 15 (i.e. not 9)  
####   
#### ## Iteration 4 — Errors  
####   
#### The parser should reject:  
####   
#### - Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")  
#### - Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")  
#### - Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: wordy.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the `Answer` function in wordy.go that parses and evaluates math word problems. The implementation needs to handle simple number questions, basic arithmetic operations (including multi-word operators like "multiplied by"), and reject invalid questions.

Here's the SEARCH/REPLACE block to update the code:

wordy.go
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package wordy

func Answer(question string) (int, bool) {
	panic("Please implement the Answer function")
}
=======
package wordy

import (
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func Answer(question string) (int, bool) {
	if !strings.HasPrefix(question, "What is ") || !strings.HasSuffix(question, "?") {
		return 0, false
	}

	expr := strings.TrimSpace(strings.TrimSuffix(strings.TrimPrefix(question, "What is "), "?"))
	if expr == "" {
		return 0, false
	}

	words := strings.Fields(expr)
	var tokens []string

	for i := 0; i < len(words); {
		// Check for two-word operators first
		if i+1 < len(words) {
			if (words[i] == "multiplied" && words[i+1] == "by") || (words[i] == "divided" && words[i+1] == "by") {
				tokens = append(tokens, words[i]+" "+words[i+1])
				i += 2
				continue
			}
		}

		// Check single-word operators
		if words[i] == "plus" || words[i] == "minus" {
			tokens = append(tokens, words[i])
			i++
			continue
		}

		// Check if it's a number
		if _, err := strconv.Atoi(words[i]); err == nil {
			tokens = append(tokens, words[i])
			i++
			continue
		}

		// Invalid token
		return 0, false
	}

	if len(tokens) == 0 {
		return 0, false
	}

	// Validate and parse initial number
	initialNum, err := strconv.Atoi(tokens[0])
	if err != nil {
		return 0, false
	}

	if len(tokens) == 1 {
		return initialNum, true
	}

	// Validate operator-number pairs
	for i := 1; i < len(tokens); i += 2 {
		// Check operator validity
		op := tokens[i]
		if op != "plus" && op != "minus" && op != "multiplied by" && op != "divided by" {
			return 0, false
		}

		// Check number existence and validity
		if i+1 >= len(tokens) {
			return 0, false
		}
		numStr := tokens[i+1]
		if _, err := strconv.Atoi(numStr); err != nil {
			return 0, false
		}
	}

	// Perform calculations
	result := initialNum
	for i := 1; i < len(tokens); i += 2 {
		op := tokens[i]
		num, _ := strconv.Atoi(tokens[i+1]) // already validated above

		switch op {
		case "plus":
			result += num
		case "minus":
			result -= num
		case "multiplied by":
			result *= num
		case "divided by":
			result /= num
		}
	}

	return result, true
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Validates the question format (must start with "What is " and end with "?")
2. Extracts and tokenizes the expression, handling both single-word ("plus", "minus") and multi-word operators ("multiplied by", "divided by")
3. Validates the token structure (must alternate between numbers and operators)
4. Performs calculations left-to-right as specified
5. Handles errors like invalid syntax, unsupported operations, and non-math questions

The code will correctly handle all the test cases from the instructions, including:
- Simple numbers ("What is 5?")
- Basic arithmetic ("What is 5 plus 13?")
- Multi-word operations ("What is 6 multiplied by 4?")
- Multiple operations ("What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?")
- Negative numbers ("What is -5 plus 10?")
- Error cases (invalid syntax, unsupported operations, non-math questions)

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
