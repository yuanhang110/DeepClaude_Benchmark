#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
#### # Implementation  
####   
#### Define a single Go func, Cost, which calculates the cost  
#### for a given list of books based on the defined discounts.  
####   
#### Use the following signature for func Cost:  
####   
#### ```  
#### func Cost(books []int) int  
#### ```  
#### Cost will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.  
#### For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.  
#### Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.  
####   
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book_store.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the necessary changes to implement the `Cost` function in the `book_store.go` file based on the provided requirements:

```go
book_store.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package bookstore

func Cost(books []int) int {
	panic("Please implement the Cost function")
}
=======
package bookstore

import (
	"sort"
)

func Cost(books []int) int {
	counts := make([]int, 5)
	for _, b := range books {
		counts[b-1]++
	}

	groups := make([]int, 6) // indexes 0-5 (0 unused)

	// Form groups greedily
	for {
		// Sort counts in descending order
		sort.Slice(counts, func(i, j int) bool {
			return counts[i] > counts[j]
		})

		// Find maximum possible group size
		maxGroup := 0
		for maxGroup < 5 && counts[maxGroup] > 0 {
			maxGroup++
		}

		if maxGroup == 0 {
			break
		}

		groups[maxGroup]++
		for i := 0; i < maxGroup; i++ {
			counts[i]--
		}
	}

	// Adjust groups: replace 5+3 with 4+4
	replacements := min(groups[5], groups[3])
	groups[5] -= replacements
	groups[3] -= replacements
	groups[4] += replacements * 2

	// Calculate total cost
	total := 0
	for k, cnt := range groups {
		switch k {
		case 1:
			total += cnt * 800
		case 2:
			total += cnt * (2 * 800 * 95 / 100)
		case 3:
			total += cnt * (3 * 800 * 90 / 100)
		case 4:
			total += cnt * (4 * 800 * 80 / 100)
		case 5:
			total += cnt * (5 * 800 * 75 / 100)
		}
	}

	return total
}

// Helper function to avoid using math.Min which uses float64
func min(a, b int) int {
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This block will add the necessary logic to calculate the cost of the books while applying the appropriate discounts based on the number of different titles purchased. Please apply these changes to your `book_store.go` file.
