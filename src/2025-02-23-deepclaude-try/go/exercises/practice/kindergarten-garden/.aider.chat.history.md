#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the kindergarten garden code based on the reasoning. Here are the necessary changes using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

1. First, let's add the imports and define the Garden struct:

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package kindergarten

// Define the Garden type here.

=======
package kindergarten

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"strings"
)

type Garden struct {
	plants map[string][]string
}

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Next, implement the NewGarden function:

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func NewGarden(diagram string, children []string) (*Garden, error) {
	panic("Please implement the NewGarden function")
}
=======
func NewGarden(diagram string, children []string) (*Garden, error) {
	// Check for duplicate children
	childMap := make(map[string]bool)
	for _, child := range children {
		if childMap[child] {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("duplicate child name: %s", child)
		}
		childMap[child] = true
	}

	// Sort a copy of the children slice
	sorted := make([]string, len(children))
	copy(sorted, children)
	sort.Strings(sorted)

	// Parse diagram rows
	var nonEmptyRows []string
	for _, row := range strings.Split(diagram, "\n") {
		if row != "" {
			nonEmptyRows = append(nonEmptyRows, row)
		}
	}
	if len(nonEmptyRows) != 2 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("diagram must have exactly two non-empty rows, got %d", len(nonEmptyRows))
	}
	row1, row2 := nonEmptyRows[0], nonEmptyRows[1]

	// Validate row lengths
	expectedLen := 2 * len(children)
	if len(row1) != expectedLen || len(row2) != expectedLen {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("rows must have exactly %d characters each", expectedLen)
	}

	// Validate plant codes
	for _, c := range row1 + row2 {
		if !strings.ContainsRune("VRCG", c) {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid plant code '%c'", c)
		}
	}

	// Build plants mapping
	plantsMap := make(map[string][]string, len(children))
	for i, child := range sorted {
		start := i * 2
		var plants []string
		for _, c := range row1[start : start+2] {
			plants = append(plants, codeToPlant(c))
		}
		for _, c := range row2[start : start+2] {
			plants = append(plants, codeToPlant(c))
		}
		plantsMap[child] = plants
	}

	return &Garden{plants: plantsMap}, nil
}

func codeToPlant(c rune) string {
	switch c {
	case 'V':
		return "violets"
	case 'R':
		return "radishes"
	case 'C':
		return "clover"
	default: // 'G' is only remaining valid option
		return "grass"
	}
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. Finally, implement the Plants method:

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func (g *Garden) Plants(child string) ([]string, bool) {
	panic("Please implement the Plants function")
}
=======
func (g *Garden) Plants(child string) ([]string, bool) {
	plants, ok := g.plants[child]
	if !ok {
		return nil, false
	}
	// Return a copy to prevent modification of internal data
	copyPlants := make([]string, len(plants))
	copy(copyPlants, plants)
	return copyPlants, true
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes implement a complete solution that:
1. Correctly handles the garden diagram format
2. Validates input data
3. Maps plant codes to full names
4. Returns plants for each child in the correct order
5. Handles errors appropriately
6. Uses safe practices like returning copies of slices

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in kindergarten_garden.go to resolve the errors.  

Based on the reasoning, the issue is that the code isn't properly enforcing the diagram format requirement where it must start with a newline. Let me fix that by modifying the diagram parsing logic in NewGarden.

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	// Parse diagram rows
	var nonEmptyRows []string
	for _, row := range strings.Split(diagram, "\n") {
		if row != "" {
			nonEmptyRows = append(nonEmptyRows, row)
		}
	}
	if len(nonEmptyRows) != 2 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("diagram must have exactly two non-empty rows, got %d", len(nonEmptyRows))
	}
	row1, row2 := nonEmptyRows[0], nonEmptyRows[1]
=======
	// Parse diagram rows
	rows := strings.Split(diagram, "\n")
	if len(rows) != 3 || rows[0] != "" {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("diagram must start with newline and have exactly two rows")
	}
	row1, row2 := rows[1], rows[2]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Directly checks the split result should have exactly 3 parts (empty first line + two rows)
2. Verifies the first part is empty (meaning diagram starts with newline)
3. Uses the second and third parts as the actual rows
4. Returns an error if the format is incorrect

This should fix the test failure by properly enforcing the diagram format requirement.
