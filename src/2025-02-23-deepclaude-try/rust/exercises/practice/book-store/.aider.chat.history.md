#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the book pricing function based on the detailed reasoning. Here's the solution using a SEARCH/REPLACE block:



lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
pub fn lowest_price(books: &[u32]) -> u32 {
    todo!("Find the lowest price of the bookbasket with books {books:?}")
}
=======
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub fn lowest_price(books: &[u32]) -> u32 {
    let mut counts = [0; 5];
    for &book in books {
        if book >= 1 && book <= 5 {
            counts[(book - 1) as usize] += 1;
        }
    }
    let mut counts_vec = counts.to_vec();
    counts_vec.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a));
    let mut cache = HashMap::new();
    compute_min_cost(&counts_vec, &mut cache)
}

fn compute_min_cost(counts: &Vec<u32>, cache: &mut HashMap<Vec<u32>, u32>) -> u32 {
    if counts.iter().all(|&c| c == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    if let Some(&cached) = cache.get(counts) {
        return cached;
    }
    
    let mut min_cost = u32::MAX;
    for k in (1..=5).rev() {
        // Check if we can form a group of size `k`
        if counts.len() < k || counts[0..k].iter().any(|&c| c == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Create new counts state
        let mut new_counts = counts.clone();
        for i in 0..k {
            new_counts[i] -= 1;
        }
        new_counts.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| b.cmp(a));
        
        // Calculate cost recursively
        let cost = compute_min_cost(&new_counts, cache) + calculate_group_cost(k);
        if cost < min_cost {
            min_cost = cost;
        }
    }
    
    cache.insert(counts.clone(), min_cost);
    min_cost
}

fn calculate_group_cost(k: usize) -> u32 {
    match k {
        1 => 800,                    // No discount
        2 => 2 * 800 * 95 / 100,    // 5% discount
        3 => 3 * 800 * 90 / 100,    // 10% discount
        4 => 4 * 800 * 80 / 100,    // 20% discount
        5 => 5 * 800 * 75 / 100,    // 25% discount
        _ => 0,
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a slice of book numbers (1-5) as input
2. Counts how many of each book appear in the basket
3. Uses dynamic programming with memoization to find the optimal grouping of books that gives the lowest total price
4. Handles all the discount cases (5% for 2 books, 10% for 3, 20% for 4, and 25% for 5)
5. Returns the price in cents (e.g., 5120 for $51.20)

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
