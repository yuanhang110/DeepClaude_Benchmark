#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 0 — Numbers  
####   
#### Problems with no operations simply evaluate to the number given.  
####   
#### > What is 5?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 5.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 1 — Addition  
####   
#### Add two numbers together.  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13?  
####   
#### Evaluates to 18.  
####   
#### Handle large numbers and negative numbers.  
####   
#### ## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division  
####   
#### Now, perform the other three operations.  
####   
#### > What is 7 minus 5?  
####   
#### 2  
####   
#### > What is 6 multiplied by 4?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 25 divided by 5?  
####   
#### 5  
####   
#### ## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations  
####   
#### Handle a set of operations, in sequence.  
####   
#### Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._  
####   
#### > What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?  
####   
#### 24  
####   
#### > What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?  
####   
#### 15 (i.e. not 9)  
####   
#### ## Iteration 4 — Errors  
####   
#### The parser should reject:  
####   
#### - Unsupported operations ("What is 52 cubed?")  
#### - Non-math questions ("Who is the President of the United States")  
#### - Word problems with invalid syntax ("What is 1 plus plus 2?")  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### To get the bonus tests to run, execute the tests with:  
####   
#### ```bash  
#### $ cargo test --features exponentials  
#### ```  
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help modify the lib.rs file to implement the math word problem parser and evaluator. Let me provide a SEARCH/REPLACE block based on the detailed requirements and reasoning:



lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
pub fn answer(command: &str) -> Option<i32> {
    todo!("Return the result of the command '{command}' or None, if the command is invalid.");
}
=======
pub fn answer(command: &str) -> Option<i32> {
    // Check command format
    if !command.starts_with("What is ") || !command.ends_with('?') {
        return None;
    }
    
    // Extract expression and normalize operators
    let expr = command["What is ".len()..command.len()-1].trim();
    let expr = expr
        .replace("multiplied by", "*")
        .replace("divided by", "/")
        .replace("plus", "+")
        .replace("minus", "-");
    
    // Split into tokens
    let tokens: Vec<&str> = expr.split_whitespace().collect();
    if tokens.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }
    
    // Parse initial number
    let initial = tokens[0].parse::<i32>().ok()?;
    
    // Check remaining tokens form valid operation pairs
    if (tokens.len() - 1) % 2 != 0 {
        return None;
    }
    
    // Parse operations
    let mut operations = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..(tokens.len() - 1) / 2 {
        let op_index = 1 + 2 * i;
        let num_index = op_index + 1;
        
        if op_index >= tokens.len() || num_index >= tokens.len() {
            return None;
        }
        
        let op = tokens[op_index];
        let num = tokens[num_index].parse::<i32>().ok()?;
        operations.push((op, num));
    }
    
    // Evaluate operations left-to-right
    let mut result = initial;
    for (op, num) in operations {
        match op {
            "+" => result += num,
            "-" => result -= num,
            "*" => result *= num,
            "/" => {
                if num == 0 {
                    return None;
                }
                result /= num;
            }
            _ => return None, // Invalid operator
        }
    }
    
    Some(result)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Handles all basic operations (plus, minus, multiplied by, divided by)
2. Evaluates expressions left-to-right as specified
3. Handles errors including:
   - Invalid syntax
   - Division by zero 
   - Unsupported operations
   - Non-math questions
4. Supports negative numbers
5. Processes multi-word operators correctly
6. Validates the format "What is ... ?"

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
