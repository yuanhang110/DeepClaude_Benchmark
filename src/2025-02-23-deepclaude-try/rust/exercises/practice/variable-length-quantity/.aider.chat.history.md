#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll provide the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to implement VLQ encoding and decoding based on the detailed analysis. The modified functions will correctly handle all the edge cases, including the [0x80] scenario.

First, let's update the `to_bytes` function:

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/// Convert a list of numbers to a stream of bytes encoded with variable length encoding.
pub fn to_bytes(values: &[u32]) -> Vec<u8> {
    todo!("Convert the values {values:?} to a list of bytes")
}
=======
/// Convert a list of numbers to a stream of bytes encoded with variable length encoding.
pub fn to_bytes(values: &[u32]) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    for &value in values {
        let mut chunks = Vec::new();
        let mut num = value;
        if num == 0 {
            chunks.push(0);
        } else {
            while num > 0 {
                chunks.push((num & 0x7F) as u8);
                num >>= 7;
            }
            chunks.reverse();
        }
        for i in 0..chunks.len() {
            let mut byte = chunks[i];
            if i != chunks.len() - 1 {
                byte |= 0x80;
            }
            result.push(byte);
        }
    }
    result
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's update the `from_bytes` function with the corrected logic that properly handles incomplete sequences:

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/// Given a stream of bytes, extract all numbers which are encoded in there.
pub fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u32>, Error> {
    todo!("Convert the list of bytes {bytes:?} to a list of numbers")
}
=======
/// Given a stream of bytes, extract all numbers which are encoded in there.
pub fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u32>, Error> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    let mut current = 0;
    let mut has_pending = false;
    for &byte in bytes {
        current = (current << 7) | (byte & 0x7F) as u32;
        if (byte & 0x80) == 0 {
            result.push(current);
            current = 0;
            has_pending = false;
        } else {
            has_pending = true;
        }
    }
    if has_pending || current != 0 {
        Err(Error::IncompleteNumber)
    } else {
        Ok(result)
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These implementations:
1. Correctly encode numbers using VLQ encoding
2. Handle the decoding of complete sequences
3. Properly detect incomplete sequences, including the edge case where a byte with high bit set appears at the end
4. Handle zero values correctly
5. Follow the encoding rules where each number must end with a byte that has its high bit clear

The code matches all the example cases provided in the problem description and handles edge cases like [0x80] appropriately.
