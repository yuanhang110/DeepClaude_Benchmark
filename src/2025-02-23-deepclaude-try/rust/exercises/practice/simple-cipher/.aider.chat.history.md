#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement a simple shift cipher like Caesar and a more secure substitution cipher.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### "If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.  
#### If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."  
#### â€”Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar  
####   
#### Ciphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render text less readable while still allowing easy deciphering.  
#### They are vulnerable to many forms of cryptanalysis, but Caesar was lucky that his enemies were not cryptanalysts.  
####   
#### The Caesar Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that were sent afield.  
#### Now Caesar knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well.  
#### So even being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't recognize the few words that they did know.  
####   
#### Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher.  
#### This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:  
####   
#### ![Caesar Cipher][img-caesar-cipher]  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### Giving "iamapandabear" as input to the encode function returns the cipher "ldpdsdqgdehdu".  
#### Obscure enough to keep our message secret in transit.  
####   
#### When "ldpdsdqgdehdu" is put into the decode function it would return the original "iamapandabear" letting your friend read your original message.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Shift ciphers quickly cease to be useful when the opposition commander figures them out.  
#### So instead, let's try using a substitution cipher.  
#### Try amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance.  
####   
#### Here's an example:  
####   
#### Given the key "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", encoding the string "iamapandabear"  
#### would return the original "iamapandabear".  
####   
#### Given the key "ddddddddddddddddd", encoding our string "iamapandabear"  
#### would return the obscured "ldpdsdqgdehdu"  
####   
#### In the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value.  
#### So when the plaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming out.  
#### So "aaaa" is not an ideal key.  
#### But if we set the key to "dddd", we would get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### The weakest link in any cipher is the human being.  
#### Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that the key contains only lowercase letters.  
####   
#### If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 lowercase characters in length.  
####   
#### ## Extensions  
####   
#### Shift ciphers work by making the text slightly odd, but are vulnerable to frequency analysis.  
#### Substitution ciphers help that, but are still very vulnerable when the key is short or if spaces are preserved.  
#### Later on you'll see one solution to this problem in the exercise "crypto-square".  
####   
#### If you want to go farther in this field, the questions begin to be about how we can exchange keys in a secure way.  
#### Take a look at [Diffie-Hellman on Wikipedia][dh] for one of the first implementations of this scheme.  
####

#### [dh]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the shift cipher based on the instructions. Let me provide the code changes using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

pub fn encode_random(s: &str) -> (String, String) {

pub fn encode_random(s: &str) -> (String, String) {
    use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};
    
    let seed = SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .unwrap()
        .as_nanos();
    
    let mut rng = seed;
    let mut key = String::new();
    for _ in 0..100 {
        rng = rng.wrapping_mul(1103515245).wrapping_add(12345);
        let c = (rng % 26) as u8;
        key.push((b'a' + c) as char);
    }
    
    let encoded = encode(&key, s).expect("Invalid input");
    (key, encoded)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes implement:

1. Input validation for encode/decode:
   - Key must be non-empty and contain only lowercase letters
   - Input string must contain only lowercase letters
   - Returns None for invalid inputs

2. Substitution cipher functionality:
   - Each character in the key determines the shift for corresponding input characters
   - Key is used cyclically if shorter than input
   - Shifts wrap around the alphabet using modulo 26

3. Random key generation:
   - Creates a 100-character key using system time as seed
   - Uses basic linear congruential generator for pseudo-randomness
   - Only generates lowercase letters a-z

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
