I've implemented a complete solution for evaluating poker hands. Here's how it works:

1. **Card Parsing**:
   - Each card is parsed into a value and suit
   - Values are mapped to numbers (2-14, with Ace as 14)
   - Hands are parsed into objects containing the cards, sorted values, and suits

2. **Hand Evaluation**:
   - Checks each hand type from highest (straight flush) to lowest (high card)
   - Special handling for ace-low straights (A-2-3-4-5)
   - Creates a comparison key for each hand type that ensures proper ordering

3. **Hand Comparison**:
   - Compares hands first by rank, then by the comparison key
   - Handles tiebreakers correctly (e.g., kickers in pairs)
   - Returns 0 for equal hands

4. **Best Hand Selection**:
   - Finds the best hand using reduce and compareHands
   - Returns all hands that tie for best

The code handles all standard poker hand rankings and edge cases like:
- Ace-low straights
- Multiple hands of the same rank
- Proper kicker comparison
- Empty input arrays

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail or see how specific hands would be evaluated?

  Poker
    ✓ single hand always wins (2 ms)
    ✓ highest card out of all hands wins
    ✓ a tie has multiple winners (1 ms)
    ✓ multiple hands with the same high cards, tie compares next highest ranked, down to last card
    ✓ one pair beats high card
    ✓ highest pair wins
    ✓ two pairs beats one pair
    ✓ both hands have two pairs, highest ranked pair wins (1 ms)
    ✓ both hands have two pairs, with the same highest ranked pair, tie goes to low pair
    ✓ both hands have two identically ranked pairs, tie goes to remaining card (kicker)
    ✓ three of a kind beats two pair
    ✓ both hands have three of a kind, tie goes to highest ranked triplet (1 ms)
    ✓ with multiple decks, two players can have same three of a kind, ties go to highest remaining cards
    ✓ a straight beats three of a kind
    ✓ aces can end a straight (10 J Q K A)
    ✓ aces can start a straight (A 2 3 4 5)
    ✓ both hands with a straight, tie goes to highest ranked card
    ✓ even though an ace is usually high, a 5-high straight is the lowest-scoring straight
    ✓ flush beats a straight
    ✓ both hands have a flush, tie goes to high card, down to the last one if necessary
    ✓ full house beats a flush
    ✓ both hands have a full house, tie goes to highest-ranked triplet
    ✓ with multiple decks, both hands have a full house with the same triplet, tie goes to the pair
    ✓ four of a kind beats a full house
    ✓ both hands have four of a kind, tie goes to high quad (1 ms)
    ✓ with multiple decks, both hands with identical four of a kind, tie determined by kicker
    ✓ straight flush beats four of a kind
    ✓ both hands have straight flush, tie goes to highest-ranked card
