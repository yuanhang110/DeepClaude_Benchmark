#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: twelve-days.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help create the solution for the Twelve Days of Christmas exercise. Based on the reasoning, we need to modify the recite function to generate the lyrics with the correct formatting, gifts, and ordinals.

  const verses = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
    const currentGifts = gifts.slice(0, i + 1).reverse();
    let giftsList;
    if (currentGifts.length === 1) {
      giftsList = currentGifts[0];
    } else {
      giftsList = currentGifts.slice(0, -1).join(', ') + ', and ' + currentGifts[currentGifts.length - 1];
    }
    verses.push(`On the ${ordinals[i]} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ${giftsList}.\n`);
  }
  return verses.join('\n');
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```


This implementation:

1. Creates arrays for the ordinals (first through twelfth) and gifts (starting with partridge and ending with drummers)
2. For each verse:
   - Gets the gifts for that day by slicing and reversing the gifts array
   - Formats the gifts list with proper commas and "and" before the last item
   - Creates the verse string with the correct ordinal and gifts
   - Adds a newline at the end of each verse
3. Joins all verses with newlines, creating blank lines between verses

Each verse will have the format "On the [ordinal] day of Christmas my true love gave to me: [gifts].\n" and verses are separated by blank lines in the output. The implementation matches the exact formatting required in the sample lyrics.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the implementation?
