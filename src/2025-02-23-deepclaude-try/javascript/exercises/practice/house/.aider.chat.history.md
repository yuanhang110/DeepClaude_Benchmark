#### Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.

Based on the detailed analysis, I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to implement the House class that generates the nursery rhyme "This is the House that Jack Built" using recursion and embedding principles.

The implementation uses a static parts array where each part contains a subject and an action. The action connects to the previous part's subject when building the verses. The verse method reverses the parts up to the requested verse number, then builds lines by combining actions with subjects. The verses method generates a range of verses joined by double newlines.

    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');

export class House {
  static parts = [
    { subject: 'the house that Jack built.', action: '' },
    { subject: 'the malt', action: 'lay in ' },
    { subject: 'the rat', action: 'ate ' },
    { subject: 'the cat', action: 'killed ' },
    { subject: 'the dog', action: 'worried ' },
    { subject: 'the cow with the crumpled horn', action: 'tossed ' },
    { subject: 'the maiden all forlorn', action: 'milked ' },
    { subject: 'the man all tattered and torn', action: 'kissed ' },
    { subject: 'the priest all shaven and shorn', action: 'married ' },
    { subject: 'the rooster that crowed in the morn', action: 'woke ' },
    { subject: 'the farmer sowing his corn', action: 'kept ' },
    { subject: 'the horse and the hound and the horn', action: 'belonged to ' }
  ];

  static verse(n) {
    const reversedParts = House.parts.slice(0, n).reverse();
    let lines = [`This is ${reversedParts[0].subject}`];
    for (let i = 0; i < reversedParts.length - 1; i++) {
      lines.push(`that ${reversedParts[i].action}${reversedParts[i + 1].subject}`);
    }
    return lines.join('\n');
  }

  static verses(start, end) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
      result.push(House.verse(i));
    }
    return result.join('\n\n');
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a static parts array where each part has a subject and an action
2. For verse n, takes parts 0 to n-1 in reverse order
3. First line is "This is" plus the current part's subject
4. Subsequent lines combine "that" + current part's action + next part's subject
5. Joins verse lines with newlines
6. Joins multiple verses with double newlines

The code demonstrates the embedding principle by building each verse through recursive combination of parts, where each new verse embeds all previous verses within its structure.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in house.js to resolve the errors.  

I'll make the necessary changes to make the House class pass the tests. The key issues are:
1. verse() needs to return an array of lines instead of joining them with newlines
2. verses() needs to return a flattened array with empty strings between verses

Here are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix these issues:

house.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return lines.join('\n');
=======
    return lines;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

house.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    result.push(House.verse(i));
  }
  return result.join('\n\n');
=======
    const verseLines = House.verse(i);
    result.push(...verseLines);
    if (i !== end) {
      result.push('');
    }
  }
  return result;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:
1. Make verse() return an array of lines instead of a joined string
2. Make verses() collect all verse lines into a flattened array with empty strings between verses
3. Match the test expectations for both single verses and multiple verses

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail!
