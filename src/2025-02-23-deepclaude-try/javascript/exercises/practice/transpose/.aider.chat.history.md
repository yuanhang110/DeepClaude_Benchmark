#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an input text output it transposed.  
####   
#### Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### is given by:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### CF  
#### ```  
####   
#### Rows become columns and columns become rows.  
#### See [transpose][].  
####   
#### If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:  
####   
#### - Pad to the left with spaces.  
#### - Don't pad to the right.  
####   
#### Therefore, transposing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DE  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### C  
#### ```  
####   
#### And transposing:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AB  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
####  F  
#### ```  
####   
#### In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.  
#### That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).  
####   
#### [transpose]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: transpose.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to implement the transpose function. The solution will process each column index by iterating through rows in reverse order, handling padding correctly based on whether there are longer rows below the current row.



transpose.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const transpose = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const transpose = (input) => {
    if (input.length === 0) return [];
    
    const maxLen = Math.max(...input.map(row => row.length));
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
        let transposedRow = [];
        let pad = false;
        
        for (let j = input.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            const row = input[j];
            if (row.length > i) {
                transposedRow.unshift(row[i]);
                pad = true;
            } else if (pad) {
                transposedRow.unshift(' ');
            }
        }
        
        result.push(transposedRow.join(''));
    }
    
    return result;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Handles empty input by returning an empty array
2. Finds the maximum row length which determines number of columns in output
3. For each column index i:
   - Processes rows in reverse order to determine padding requirements
   - If a row has a character at index i, adds it and marks that padding is needed for shorter rows above
   - If a row is too short but we've seen longer rows below, adds a space
4. Joins characters in each transposed row into a string

Would you like me to walk through how this handles specific test cases?
