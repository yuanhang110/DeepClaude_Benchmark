#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Every month, your partner meets up with their best friend.  
#### Both of them have very busy schedules, making it challenging to find a suitable date!  
#### Given your own busy schedule, your partner always double-checks potential meetup dates with you:  
####   
#### - "Can I meet up on the first Friday of next month?"  
#### - "What about the third Wednesday?"  
#### - "Maybe the last Sunday?"  
####   
#### In this month's call, your partner asked you this question:  
####   
#### - "I'd like to meet up on the teenth Thursday; is that okay?"  
####   
#### Confused, you ask what a "teenth" day is.  
#### Your partner explains that a teenth day, a concept they made up, refers to the days in a month that end in '-teenth':  
####   
#### - 13th (thirteenth)  
#### - 14th (fourteenth)  
#### - 15th (fifteenth)  
#### - 16th (sixteenth)  
#### - 17th (seventeenth)  
#### - 18th (eighteenth)  
#### - 19th (nineteenth)  
####   
#### As there are also seven weekdays, it is guaranteed that each day of the week has _exactly one_ teenth day each month.  
####   
#### Now that you understand the concept of a teenth day, you check your calendar.  
#### You don't have anything planned on the teenth Thursday, so you happily confirm the date with your partner.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to find the exact date of a meetup, given a month, year, weekday and week.  
####   
#### There are five week values to consider: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`, `teenth`.  
####   
#### For example, you might be asked to find the date for the meetup on the first Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018).  
####   
#### Similarly, you might be asked to find:  
####   
#### - the third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)  
#### - the teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
#### - the fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)  
#### - the last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)  
#### - the teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)  
####   
#### ## Teenth  
####   
#### The teenth week refers to the seven days in a month that end in '-teenth' (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th).  
####   
#### If asked to find the teenth Saturday of August, 1953, we check its calendar:  
####   
#### ```plaintext  
####     August 1953  
#### Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
####                    1  
####  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
####  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
#### 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
#### 23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
#### 30 31  
#### ```  
####   
#### From this we find that the teenth Saturday is August 15, 1953.  
#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### In JavaScript, the Date object month's index ranges from 0 to 11.  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### const date = new Date('2020-06-13');  
#### date.getFullYear();  
#### // => 2020  
#### date.getMonth();  
#### // => 5 (instead of 6)  
#### date.getDate();  
#### // => 13  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: meetup.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Let me help you implement the meetup function based on the requirements. Here's a complete solution using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

meetup.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
//
// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Meetup' exercise. It's been provided as a
// convenience to get you started writing code faster.
//

export const meetup = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
const DAYS = {
  Sunday: 0,
  Monday: 1,
  Tuesday: 2,
  Wednesday: 3,
  Thursday: 4,
  Friday: 5,
  Saturday: 6
};

export const meetup = (year, month, week, weekday) => {
  // Convert month to 0-based index
  const monthIndex = month - 1;
  const targetDay = DAYS[weekday];
  
  // Handle teenth case
  if (week === 'teenth') {
    for (let day = 13; day <= 19; day++) {
      const date = new Date(year, monthIndex, day);
      if (date.getDay() === targetDay) {
        return date;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Get all matching weekdays in the month
  const matchingDays = [];
  const lastDay = new Date(year, monthIndex + 1, 0).getDate();
  
  for (let day = 1; day <= lastDay; day++) {
    const date = new Date(year, monthIndex, day);
    if (date.getDay() === targetDay) {
      matchingDays.push(date);
    }
  }

  // Return the appropriate date based on the week descriptor
  switch (week) {
    case 'first':
      return matchingDays[0];
    case 'second':
      return matchingDays[1];
    case 'third':
      return matchingDays[2];
    case 'fourth':
      return matchingDays[3];
    case 'last':
      return matchingDays[matchingDays.length - 1];
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid week descriptor');
  }
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a DAYS object to map weekday names to their numeric values (0-6)
2. Adjusts the month input to be 0-based for JavaScript's Date object
3. Handles the special 'teenth' case by checking days 13-19
4. For other cases, finds all matching weekdays in the month
5. Returns the appropriate date based on the week descriptor (first, second, third, fourth, or last)

The code handles all the example cases mentioned in the instructions:
- First Monday in January 2018 (January 1, 2018)
- Third Tuesday of August 2019 (August 20, 2019)
- Teenth Wednesday of May 2020 (May 13, 2020)  
- Fourth Sunday of July 2021 (July 25, 2021)
- Last Thursday of November 2022 (November 24, 2022)
- Teenth Saturday of August 1953 (August 15, 1953)

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
