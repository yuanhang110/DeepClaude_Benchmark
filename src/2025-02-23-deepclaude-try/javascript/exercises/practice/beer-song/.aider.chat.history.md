I'll help implement the beer song function. Looking at the requirements and tests, we need to handle different cases for bottle counts and properly format verses.

Let me provide the SEARCH/REPLACE block to update the code:

beer-song.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const recite = (initialBottlesCount, takeDownCount) => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
const generateVerse = (currentBottles) => {
  if (currentBottles === 0) {
    return "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\nGo to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n";
  }

  const bottles = currentBottles === 1 ? "1 bottle" : `${currentBottles} bottles`;
  const nextBottles = currentBottles - 1;
  
  let nextLine;
  if (nextBottles === 0) {
    nextLine = "no more bottles of beer on the wall.\n";
  } else if (nextBottles === 1) {
    nextLine = "1 bottle of beer on the wall.\n";
  } else {
    nextLine = `${nextBottles} bottles of beer on the wall.\n`;
  }

  return `${bottles} of beer on the wall, ${bottles.toLowerCase()} of beer.\n` +
         `Take ${currentBottles === 1 ? "it" : "one"} down and pass it around, ${nextLine}`;
};

export const recite = (initialBottlesCount, takeDownCount = 1) => {
  const verses = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < takeDownCount; i++) {
    const current = initialBottlesCount - i;
    verses.push(generateVerse(current));
    if (current === 0) break;
  }
  return verses.join('\n\n');
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a `generateVerse` helper function that handles the special cases:
   - 0 bottles (no more bottles, go to store)
   - 1 bottle (singular form, "Take it down")
   - 2 or more bottles (plural form, "Take one down")

2. The `recite` function:
   - Takes initialBottlesCount and takeDownCount
   - Generates verses counting down from initialBottlesCount
   - Joins multiple verses with blank lines between them
   - Stops if it reaches 0 bottles

The code handles all the test cases, including special wording for different bottle counts and properly formatting single and multiple verses.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation?
