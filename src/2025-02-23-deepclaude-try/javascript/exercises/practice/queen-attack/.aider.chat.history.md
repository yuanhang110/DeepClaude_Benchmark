#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####   
#### ## Credit  
####   
#### The chessboard image was made by [habere-et-dispertire][habere-et-dispertire] using LaTeX and the [chessboard package][chessboard-package] by Ulrike Fischer.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### A queen must be placed on a valid position on the board.  
#### Two queens cannot share the same position.  
####   
#### If a position has not been given, the queens are at their [default starting positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Initial_setup). That's the bottom row (1) for the white queen and the top row (8) for the black queen. Both queens start in the fourth column (d).

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####   
#### ## Credit  
####   
#### The chessboard image was made by [habere-et-dispertire][habere-et-dispertire] using LaTeX and the [chessboard package][chessboard-package] by Ulrike Fischer.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### A queen must be placed on a valid position on the board.  
#### Two queens cannot share the same position.  
####   
#### If a position has not been given, the queens are at their [default starting positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Initial_setup). That's the bottom row (1) for the white queen and the top row (8) for the black queen. Both queens start in the fourth column (d).
