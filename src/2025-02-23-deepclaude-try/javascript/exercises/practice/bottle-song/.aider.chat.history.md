#### ####  
####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bottle-song.js to resolve the errors.  

Based on the test failures and the problem requirements, I'll help modify the bottle-song.js file to correctly implement the bottle song recitation. The solution needs to handle single verses and multiple verses, with proper pluralization and number words.




```javascript 
export const recite = (initialBottlesCount, takeDownCount) => {
  const numberWords = {
    10: 'Ten',
    9: 'Nine',
    8: 'Eight',
    7: 'Seven',
    6: 'Six',
    5: 'Five',
    4: 'Four',
    3: 'Three',
    2: 'Two',
    1: 'One',
    0: 'No'
  };

  const verses = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < takeDownCount; i++) {
    const current = initialBottlesCount - i;
    if (current < 1) break;

    const currentWord = numberWords[current];
    const currentBottle = current === 1 ? 'bottle' : 'bottles';
    const nextBottles = current - 1;
    const nextWord = nextBottles === 0 ? 'no' : numberWords[nextBottles].toLowerCase();
    const nextBottle = nextBottles === 1 ? 'bottle' : 'bottles';

    const verse = [
      `${currentWord} green ${currentBottle} hanging on the wall,`,
      `${currentWord} green ${currentBottle} hanging on the wall,`,
      `And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,`,
      `There'll be ${nextWord} green ${nextBottle} hanging on the wall.`
    ].join('\n');

    verses.push(verse);
  }

  return verses.join('\n\n');
};

```


Now I'll create the SEARCH/REPLACE block to modify the file:

bottle-song.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const recite = (initialBottlesCount, takeDownCount) => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const recite = (initialBottlesCount, takeDownCount) => {
  const numberWords = {
    10: 'Ten',
    9: 'Nine',
    8: 'Eight',
    7: 'Seven',
    6: 'Six',
    5: 'Five',
    4: 'Four',
    3: 'Three',
    2: 'Two',
    1: 'One',
    0: 'No'
  };

  const verses = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < takeDownCount; i++) {
    const current = initialBottlesCount - i;
    if (current < 1) break;

    const currentWord = numberWords[current];
    const currentBottle = current === 1 ? 'bottle' : 'bottles';
    const nextBottles = current - 1;
    const nextWord = nextBottles === 0 ? 'no' : numberWords[nextBottles].toLowerCase();
    const nextBottle = nextBottles === 1 ? 'bottle' : 'bottles';

    const verse = [
      `${currentWord} green ${currentBottle} hanging on the wall,`,
      `${currentWord} green ${currentBottle} hanging on the wall,`,
      `And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,`,
      `There'll be ${nextWord} green ${nextBottle} hanging on the wall.`
    ].join('\n');

    verses.push(verse);
  }

  return verses.join('\n\n');
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Maps numbers to their word form (e.g., 10 -> "Ten")
2. Handles bottle/bottles pluralization correctly
3. Generates the correct number of verses based on takeDownCount
4. Joins verses with blank lines between them
5. Handles edge cases like when current is 1 (next becomes "no")
6. Uses lowercase for the next number in "There'll be..." lines

The code should now pass all test cases, including single verses and multiple verses.
