#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Before the `Promise` class was introduced, there was only one way to deal with asynchronous code : the _callback pattern_.  
####   
#### A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and will be called once some action in that other function has finished. A common pattern for those callback functions is that they accept an "error" as first parameter (see example below).  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### function callback(error, arg2, arg3) {}  
#### ```  
####   
#### How is it related to asynchronous code ?  
####   
#### Historically, callbacks have been used in order to allow us to do some work after an asynchronous task was done and without blocking the whole program.  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### fetchProduct(productId, function (error, data) {  
####   if (error) {  
####     // Handle the error  
####   } else {  
####     // Do some work  
####   }  
#### });  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the example above, the `fetchProduct` function (which is asynchronous), takes a callback as a second argument that decides what to do when the product data has been retrieved.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The two objectives of this exercise are :  
####   
#### 1. Implement a `promisify` function that turns a function using the "callback pattern" into a function that returns a `Promise`. See the example below.  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### function fetchProduct(productId, function(error, data) {  
####     if (error) {  
####         // Handle the error  
####     } else {  
####         // Make something with your data  
####     }  
#### })  
####   
#### const fetchProductAsPromise = promisify(fetchProduct);  
####   
#### // Now you got a function `fetchProductAsPromise`  
#### // that returns a promise  
#### fetchProductAsPromise(productId)  
####     .then((data) => {})  
####     .catch((error) => {});  
#### ```  
####   
#### 2. Re-implement the following built-ins `Promise` methods (without using them)  
####   
#### - `all`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them are resolved, or rejects when _one_ of them rejects.  
#### - `allSettled`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them either resolve or reject.  
#### - `race`: takes an array of promises and resolves or rejects with the value of the _first_ promise that resolves or rejects.  
#### - `any`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _one_ of them resolves, or rejects when _all_ of them reject.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: promises.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Promise-related functions in promises.js. Let me break this down into multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to make the changes clear and manageable.

First, let's implement the promisify function:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const promisify = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const promisify = (fn) => {
  return (...args) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fn(...args, (error, result) => {
        if (error) {
          reject(error);
        } else {
          resolve(result);
        }
      });
    });
  };
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's implement the Promise.all equivalent:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const all = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const all = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
    const results = new Array(promises.length);
    let completed = 0;
    
    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(result => {
          results[index] = result;
          completed++;
          if (completed === promises.length) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        })
        .catch(reject);
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for allSettled:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const allSettled = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const allSettled = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
    const results = new Array(promises.length);
    let completed = 0;

    const handleSettlement = (index, status, value) => {
      results[index] = { status, [status === 'fulfilled' ? 'value' : 'reason']: value };
      completed++;
      if (completed === promises.length) {
        resolve(results);
      }
    };

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(value => handleSettlement(index, 'fulfilled', value))
        .catch(reason => handleSettlement(index, 'rejected', reason));
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's implement race:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const race = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const race = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      return;
    }
    promises.forEach(promise => {
      Promise.resolve(promise).then(resolve).catch(reject);
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, let's implement any:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const any = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const any = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      reject(new AggregateError([], 'All promises were rejected'));
      return;
    }
    const errors = new Array(promises.length);
    let rejectedCount = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch(error => {
          errors[index] = error;
          rejectedCount++;
          if (rejectedCount === promises.length) {
            reject(new AggregateError(errors, 'All promises were rejected'));
          }
        });
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These implementations provide the following functionality:

1. `promisify`: Converts a callback-style function into a Promise-returning function
2. `all`: Resolves when all promises resolve, rejects if any reject
3. `allSettled`: Resolves when all promises settle (either resolve or reject)
4. `race`: Settles with the result of the first promise to settle
5. `any`: Resolves when any promise resolves, rejects only if all reject

Each implementation handles edge cases like:
- Non-array inputs (converting to array)
- Empty arrays
- Non-promise inputs (using Promise.resolve)
- Proper error propagation
- Maintaining the order of results where applicable

Would you like me to explain any specific part of these implementations in more detail?

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in promises.js to resolve the errors.  

I'll create SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to fix the failing tests. Let's make the changes one by one.

1. First, let's fix the 'all' function to handle no arguments:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const all = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
=======
export const all = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (promises === undefined) {
      resolve(undefined);
      return;
    }
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Fix allSettled to return raw values instead of status objects:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const allSettled = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
    const results = new Array(promises.length);
    let completed = 0;

    const handleSettlement = (index, status, value) => {
      results[index] = { status, [status === 'fulfilled' ? 'value' : 'reason']: value };
      completed++;
      if (completed === promises.length) {
        resolve(results);
      }
    };

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(value => handleSettlement(index, 'fulfilled', value))
        .catch(reason => handleSettlement(index, 'rejected', reason));
    });
  });
};
=======
export const allSettled = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (promises === undefined) {
      resolve(undefined);
      return;
    }
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
    const results = new Array(promises.length);
    let completed = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(value => {
          results[index] = value;
          completed++;
          if (completed === promises.length) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        })
        .catch(error => {
          results[index] = error;
          completed++;
          if (completed === promises.length) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        });
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. Fix race to handle empty array:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const race = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      return;
    }
=======
export const race = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

4. Fix any to handle empty array and return error array:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const any = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      reject(new AggregateError([], 'All promises were rejected'));
      return;
    }
    const errors = new Array(promises.length);
    let rejectedCount = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch(error => {
          errors[index] = error;
          rejectedCount++;
          if (rejectedCount === promises.length) {
            reject(new AggregateError(errors, 'All promises were rejected'));
          }
        });
    });
  });
};
=======
export const any = (promises) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (promises === undefined) {
      resolve(undefined);
      return;
    }
    if (!Array.isArray(promises)) {
      promises = [promises];
    }
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }
    const errors = new Array(promises.length);
    let rejectedCount = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then(resolve)
        .catch(error => {
          errors[index] = error;
          rejectedCount++;
          if (rejectedCount === promises.length) {
            reject(errors);
          }
        });
    });
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Handle undefined arguments by resolving to undefined
2. Make allSettled return raw values/errors instead of status objects
3. Make race resolve with empty array for empty input
4. Make any resolve with undefined for no args, empty array for empty input, and reject with error array instead of AggregateError
