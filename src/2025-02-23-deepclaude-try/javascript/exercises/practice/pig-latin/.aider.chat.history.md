#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Your parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.  
#### Confident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then start taking over the game.  
#### Needing a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.  
#### This will give you the edge to prevail over your parents!  
####   
#### [pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to translate text from English to Pig Latin.  
#### The translation is defined using four rules, which look at the pattern of vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.  
#### These rules look at each word's use of vowels and consonants:  
####   
#### - vowels: the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`  
#### - consonants: the other 21 letters of the English alphabet  
####   
#### ## Rule 1  
####   
#### If a word begins with a vowel, or starts with `"xr"` or `"yt"`, add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"apple"` -> `"appleay"` (starts with vowel)  
#### - `"xray"` -> `"xrayay"` (starts with `"xr"`)  
#### - `"yttria"` -> `"yttriaay"` (starts with `"yt"`)  
####   
#### ## Rule 2  
####   
#### If a word begins with one or more consonants, first move those consonants to the end of the word and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"pig"` -> `"igp"` -> `"igpay"` (starts with single consonant)  
#### - `"chair"` -> `"airch"` -> `"airchay"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
#### - `"thrush"` -> `"ushthr"` -> `"ushthray"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
####   
#### ## Rule 3  
####   
#### If a word starts with zero or more consonants followed by `"qu"`, first move those consonants (if any) and the `"qu"` part to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"quick"` -> `"ickqu"` -> `"ickquay"` (starts with `"qu"`, no preceding consonants)  
#### - `"square"` -> `"aresqu"` -> `"aresquay"` (starts with one consonant followed by `"qu`")  
####   
#### ## Rule 4  
####   
#### If a word starts with one or more consonants followed by `"y"`, first move the consonants preceding the `"y"`to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### Some examples:  
####   
#### - `"my"` -> `"ym"` -> `"ymay"` (starts with single consonant followed by `"y"`)  
#### - `"rhythm"` -> `"ythmrh"` -> `"ythmrhay"` (starts with multiple consonants followed by `"y"`)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig-latin.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on the detailed analysis, I'll provide the SEARCH/REPLACE block to implement the Pig Latin translator. The implementation handles all four rules correctly:

1. Words beginning with vowels/xr/yt get 'ay' appended
2. Words beginning with consonants move those consonants to the end and add 'ay'
3. Words with 'qu' after initial consonants move everything up to and including 'qu' to the end and add 'ay'
4. Words with 'y' after initial consonants move those consonants to the end and add 'ay'

Here's the SEARCH/REPLACE block:

pig-latin.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const translate = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const translate = (text) => {
  return text.split(' ').map(translateWord).join(' ');
};

const translateWord = (word) => {
  // Rule 1: Vowel, xr, yt at start
  if (/^(?:[aeiou]|xr|yt)/.test(word)) {
    return word + 'ay';
  }

  // Rule 3: consonants followed by qu
  const quMatch = word.match(/^([^aeiou]*qu)(.*)/);
  if (quMatch) {
    return quMatch[2] + quMatch[1] + 'ay';
  }

  // Rule 4: consonants followed by y
  const yMatch = word.match(/^([^aeiou]+)(y.*)/);
  if (yMatch) {
    return yMatch[2] + yMatch[1] + 'ay';
  }

  // Rule 2: consonants only at start
  const consonantMatch = word.match(/^([^aeiou]+)(.*)/);
  if (consonantMatch) {
    return consonantMatch[2] + consonantMatch[1] + 'ay';
  }

  // Fallback (shouldn't be reached for valid words)
  return word + 'ay';
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation will correctly handle all the example cases:
- "apple" → "appleay" (Rule 1: starts with vowel)
- "xray" → "xrayay" (Rule 1: starts with 'xr')
- "yttria" → "yttriaay" (Rule 1: starts with 'yt')
- "square" → "aresquay" (Rule 3: consonant + 'qu')
- "quick" → "ickquay" (Rule 3: starts with 'qu')
- "my" → "ymay" (Rule 4: consonant + 'y')
- "rhythm" → "ythmrhay" (Rule 4: consonants before 'y' moved)
- "pig" → "igpay" (Rule 2: initial consonant)
- "chair" → "airchay" (Rule 2: multiple initial consonants)

The `translate` function splits input text on spaces to handle multiple words, while `translateWord` applies the rules in the correct order to each individual word.
