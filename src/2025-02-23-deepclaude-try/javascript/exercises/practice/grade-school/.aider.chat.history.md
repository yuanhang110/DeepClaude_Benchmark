#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade-school.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on the detailed reasoning provided, I'll help implement the GradeSchool class with proper validation and sorting requirements. The implementation will use a combination of a Set to track all students (preventing duplicates) and an object to organize students by grade.

Here are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to modify grade-school.js:

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export class GradeSchool {
  roster() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
export class GradeSchool {
  constructor() {
    this._roster = {};
    this._students = new Set();
  }

  roster() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  add() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  add(name, grade) {
    if (this._students.has(name)) {
      throw new Error('Student already exists in the roster');
    }

    if (!this._roster[grade]) {
      this._roster[grade] = [];
    }
    
    this._roster[grade].push(name);
    this._roster[grade].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    this._students.add(name);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  grade() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  grade(gradeNumber) {
    const students = this._roster[gradeNumber] || [];
    return [...students];
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  roster() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  roster() {
    const sortedGrades = Object.keys(this._roster)
      .map(Number)
      .sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const result = {};
    for (const grade of sortedGrades) {
      result[grade] = [...this._roster[grade]];
    }
    
    return result;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a Set (_students) to prevent duplicate students across all grades
2. Maintains alphabetically sorted arrays within each grade
3. Returns deep copies of arrays to prevent external modification
4. Sorts grades numerically in the roster
5. Throws an error when attempting to add a duplicate student
6. Returns an empty array for non-existent grades

Would you like me to apply these changes?

    const sortedGrades = Object.keys(this._roster)
      .map(Number)
      .sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const result = {};

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

# The other 3 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  

Based on the analysis, I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE block that exactly matches the current code structure. The issue is that the roster() method is incomplete in the file and runs directly into the add method. Here's the correct block:

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  roster() {

  add(name, grade) {
=======
  roster() {
    const sortedGrades = Object.keys(this._roster)
      .map(Number)
      .sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const result = {};
    for (const grade of sortedGrades) {
      result[grade] = [...this._roster[grade]];
    }
    
    return result;
  }

  add(name, grade) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This matches the exact structure in the file, including the empty roster() method that's missing its closing brace and runs into the add method. The replacement adds the proper roster() implementation with complete functionality and correct syntax.

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in grade-school.js to resolve the errors.  

Based on the analysis, I understand that the current code incorrectly throws an error when attempting to add a student to a new grade, while the test expects the student to be moved to the new grade instead. Let me fix this by modifying the code to track student grades and allow grade changes.

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor() {
    this._roster = {};
    this._students = new Set();
  }
=======
  constructor() {
    this._roster = {};
    this._studentGrades = new Map();
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

grade-school.js
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  add(name, grade) {
    if (this._students.has(name)) {
      throw new Error('Student already exists in the roster');
    }

    if (!this._roster[grade]) {
      this._roster[grade] = [];
    }
    
    this._roster[grade].push(name);
    this._roster[grade].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    this._students.add(name);
  }
=======
  add(name, grade) {
    if (this._studentGrades.has(name)) {
      const previousGrade = this._studentGrades.get(name);
      const index = this._roster[previousGrade].indexOf(name);
      if (index > -1) {
        this._roster[previousGrade].splice(index, 1);
      }
      this._studentGrades.delete(name);
    }

    if (!this._roster[grade]) {
      this._roster[grade] = [];
    }
    
    this._roster[grade].push(name);
    this._roster[grade].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    this._studentGrades.set(name, grade);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Replace the `_students` Set with a `_studentGrades` Map to track which grade each student is in
2. Modify the `add` method to handle existing students by:
   - Finding and removing them from their previous grade
   - Adding them to the new grade
   - Updating their grade tracking in `_studentGrades`

This should resolve the failing test by allowing students to be moved between grades rather than throwing an error when they're added again.
