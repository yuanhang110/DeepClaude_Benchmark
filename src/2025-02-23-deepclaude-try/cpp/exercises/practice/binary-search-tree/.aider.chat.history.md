#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Insert and search for numbers in a binary tree.  
####   
#### When we need to represent sorted data, an array does not make a good data structure.  
####   
#### Say we have the array `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, and we add 2 to it so it becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.  
#### Now we must sort the entire array again!  
#### We can improve on this by realizing that we only need to make space for the new item `[1, nil, 3, 4, 5]`, and then adding the item in the space we added.  
#### But this still requires us to shift many elements down by one.  
####   
#### Binary Search Trees, however, can operate on sorted data much more efficiently.  
####   
#### A binary search tree consists of a series of connected nodes.  
#### Each node contains a piece of data (e.g. the number 3), a variable named `left`, and a variable named `right`.  
#### The `left` and `right` variables point at `nil`, or other nodes.  
#### Since these other nodes in turn have other nodes beneath them, we say that the left and right variables are pointing at subtrees.  
#### All data in the left subtree is less than or equal to the current node's data, and all data in the right subtree is greater than the current node's data.  
####   
#### For example, if we had a node containing the data 4, and we added the data 2, our tree would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      /  
####     2  
####   
#### If we then added 6, it would look like this:  
####   
####       4  
####      / \  
####     2   6  
####   
#### If we then added 3, it would look like this  
####   
####        4  
####      /   \  
####     2     6  
####      \  
####       3  
####   
#### And if we then added 1, 5, and 7, it would look like this  
####   
####           4  
####         /   \  
####        /     \  
####       2       6  
####      / \     / \  
####     1   3   5   7  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: binary_search_tree.h binary_search_tree.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the binary search tree in C++. From the problem description and empty files, I'll add Node structure and BinarySearchTree class with insertion and search capabilities.

Let's modify the files with the required functionality:

binary_search_tree.h:
```cpp
#if !defined(BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_H)
#define BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_H

namespace binary_search_tree {

}  // namespace binary_search_tree

#endif // BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_H
```

I'll implement a Node struct and BinarySearchTree class with the necessary methods. Here are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

binary_search_tree.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
namespace binary_search_tree {

}  // namespace binary_search_tree
=======
namespace binary_search_tree {
    struct Node {
        int data;
        Node* left;
        Node* right;
        
        Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    };

    class BinarySearchTree {
    private:
        Node* root_;

        // Helper functions
        Node* insert_impl(Node* current, int value);
        bool contains_impl(Node* current, int value) const;

    public:
        BinarySearchTree() : root_(nullptr) {}
        
        void insert(int value);
        bool contains(int value) const;
        const Node* root() const { return root_; }
    };
}  // namespace binary_search_tree
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

binary_search_tree.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
namespace binary_search_tree {

}  // namespace binary_search_tree
=======
namespace binary_search_tree {
    Node* BinarySearchTree::insert_impl(Node* current, int value) {
        if (current == nullptr) {
            return new Node(value);
        }
        
        if (value <= current->data) {
            current->left = insert_impl(current->left, value);
        } else {
            current->right = insert_impl(current->right, value);
        }
        
        return current;
    }

    void BinarySearchTree::insert(int value) {
        root_ = insert_impl(root_, value);
    }

    bool BinarySearchTree::contains_impl(Node* current, int value) const {
        if (current == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (current->data == value) {
            return true;
        }
        
        return value < current->data ? 
            contains_impl(current->left, value) : 
            contains_impl(current->right, value);
    }

    bool BinarySearchTree::contains(int value) const {
        return contains_impl(root_, value);
    }
}  // namespace binary_search_tree
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation includes:

1. A Node struct with:
   - Data value (int)
   - Left and right child pointers
   - Constructor to initialize values

2. A BinarySearchTree class with:
   - Private root pointer
   - Public methods for insertion and search
   - Helper methods for recursive implementation
   - Root accessor for testing/verification

The implementation follows binary search tree properties:
- All values in left subtree are <= current node
- All values in right subtree are > current node
- Supports the example operations from instructions (inserting 4,2,6,3,1,5,7)

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

I understand we need to modify the binary search tree implementation to match the test requirements. The key changes needed are:

1. Make the implementation templated to support different data types
2. Rename BinarySearchTree to binary_tree
3. Change Node to use accessor methods instead of public members
4. Update implementation to work with the templated types

Here are the necessary changes:

        return contains_impl(root_, value);
    }
}  // namespace binary_search_tree
=======
// Implementation moved to header file since it's now templated
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:

1. Made Node and binary_tree template classes with type T
2. Changed Node to use private members with accessor methods
3. Moved implementation to header file since it's templated
4. Updated parameter types to use const references
5. Made root() return non-const Node<T>* as required by tests
6. Added forward declaration of binary_tree for Node's friend declaration 

The binary_search_tree.cpp file is now empty since templated implementations need to be in the header file. The implementation logic remains the same, just adapted for templates and the new accessor methods.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail!
