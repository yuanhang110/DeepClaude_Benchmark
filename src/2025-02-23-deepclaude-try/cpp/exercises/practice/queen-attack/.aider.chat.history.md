#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####   
#### ## Credit

####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: queen_attack.h queen_attack.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
