#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.  
#### Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### - The first row contains one 'A'.  
#### - The last row contains one 'A'.  
#### - All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.  
#### - All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).  
#### - The diamond is horizontally symmetric.  
#### - The diamond is vertically symmetric.  
#### - The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).  
#### - The letters form a diamond shape.  
#### - The top half has the letters in ascending order.  
#### - The bottom half has the letters in descending order.  
#### - The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'A':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### A  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'C':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ··A··  
#### ·B·B·  
#### C···C  
#### ·B·B·  
#### ··A··  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'E':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ····A····  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### E·······E  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ····A····  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.cpp diamond.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in diamond.cpp diamond.h to resolve the errors.  

I'll help create the diamond kata implementation based on the test requirements and error messages. We need to implement the `rows` function in both the header and source files.

Let's start with the header file to declare the function:

diamond.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#pragma once

#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace diamond {
    std::vector<std::string> rows(char c);
}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's implement the function in the source file:

diamond.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "diamond.h"

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#include "diamond.h"
#include <string>
#include <vector>

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> rows(char c) {
    if (c == 'A') {
        return {"A"};
    }

    int max_distance = c - 'A';
    int size = 2 * max_distance + 1;
    std::vector<std::string> result;

    for (int i = 0; i <= 2 * max_distance; ++i) {
        int current_distance = i <= max_distance ? i : 2 * max_distance - i;
        char current_char = 'A' + current_distance;
        std::string row(size, ' ');

        int left = max_distance - current_distance;
        int right = max_distance + current_distance;
        row[left] = current_char;
        if (left != right) {
            row[right] = current_char;
        }

        result.push_back(row);
    }

    return result;
}

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Handles the special case of 'A' by returning a single-row vector
2. For other letters:
   - Calculates the distance from 'A' to determine diamond size
   - Creates each row by calculating the correct positions for the letters
   - Handles both ascending (top half) and descending (bottom half) letters
   - Maintains symmetry by placing letters at corresponding left/right positions
   - Fills remaining spaces appropriately

This should satisfy all the requirements from the kata instructions and make the tests pass.
