#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement the classic method for composing secret messages called a square code.  
####   
#### Given an English text, output the encoded version of that text.  
####   
#### First, the input is normalized: the spaces and punctuation are removed from the English text and the message is down-cased.  
####   
#### Then, the normalized characters are broken into rows.  
#### These rows can be regarded as forming a rectangle when printed with intervening newlines.  
####   
#### For example, the sentence  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "If man was meant to stay on the ground, god would have given us roots."  
#### ```  
####   
#### is normalized to:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwasmeanttostayonthegroundgodwouldhavegivenusroots"  
#### ```  
####   
#### The plaintext should be organized into a rectangle as square as possible.  
#### The size of the rectangle should be decided by the length of the message.  
####   
#### If `c` is the number of columns and `r` is the number of rows, then for the rectangle `r` x `c` find the smallest possible integer `c` such that:  
####   
#### - `r * c >= length of message`,  
#### - and `c >= r`,  
#### - and `c - r <= 1`.  
####   
#### Our normalized text is 54 characters long, dictating a rectangle with `c = 8` and `r = 7`:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "ifmanwas"  
#### "meanttos"  
#### "tayonthe"  
#### "groundgo"  
#### "dwouldha"  
#### "vegivenu"  
#### "sroots  "  
#### ```  
####   
#### The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.  
####   
#### The message above is coded as:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvsfearwermayoogoanouuiontnnlvtwttddesaohghnsseoau"  
#### ```  
####   
#### Output the encoded text in chunks that fill perfect rectangles `(r X c)`, with `c` chunks of `r` length, separated by spaces.  
#### For phrases that are `n` characters short of the perfect rectangle, pad each of the last `n` chunks with a single trailing space.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn  sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### Notice that were we to stack these, we could visually decode the ciphertext back in to the original message:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### "imtgdvs"  
#### "fearwer"  
#### "mayoogo"  
#### "anouuio"  
#### "ntnnlvt"  
#### "wttddes"  
#### "aohghn "  
#### "sseoau "  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the crypto square encoder. Let me provide the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to modify the files.



Let's start with adding the function declaration to the header:

crypto_square.h
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
=======
#if !defined(CRYPTO_SQUARE_H)
#define CRYPTO_SQUARE_H

#include <string>

namespace crypto_square {

std::string encipher(const std::string& plaintext);

}  // namespace crypto_square

#endif // CRYPTO_SQUARE_H
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now for the implementation:

crypto_square.cpp
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "crypto_square.h"

namespace crypto_square {

}  // namespace crypto_square
=======
#include "crypto_square.h"
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>

namespace crypto_square {

namespace {

std::string normalize(const std::string& input) {
    std::string result;
    for (char c : input) {
        if (std::isalnum(c)) {
            result += std::tolower(c);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

std::pair<int, int> calculate_dimensions(int len) {
    if (len == 0) return {0, 0};
    int r = static_cast<int>(std::floor(std::sqrt(len)));
    if (r == 0) r = 1;
    
    while (r * (r + 1) < len) {
        ++r;
    }
    
    int c = r + 1;
    if (r * r >= len) {
        c = r;
    }
    return {r, c};
}

std::vector<std::string> build_rectangle(const std::string& text, int r, int c) {
    std::string padded = text;
    padded.resize(r * c, ' ');
    std::vector<std::string> rows;
    for (int i = 0; i < r; ++i) {
        rows.push_back(padded.substr(i * c, c));
    }
    return rows;
}

std::string encode(const std::vector<std::string>& rectangle, int r, int c) {
    std::string encoded;
    for (int col = 0; col < c; ++col) {
        std::string chunk;
        for (int row = 0; row < r; ++row) {
            chunk += rectangle[row][col];
        }
        if (col > 0) encoded += " ";
        encoded += chunk;
    }
    return encoded;
}

} // anonymous namespace

std::string encipher(const std::string& plaintext) {
    std::string normalized = normalize(plaintext);
    auto [r, c] = calculate_dimensions(normalized.size());
    if (r == 0 || c == 0) return "";
    auto rectangle = build_rectangle(normalized, r, c);
    return encode(rectangle, r, c);
}

}  // namespace crypto_square
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

I've implemented the solution with the following key components:

1. The public `encipher` function that takes a string and returns the encoded version
2. Helper functions in an anonymous namespace:
   - `normalize`: Removes spaces/punctuation and converts to lowercase
   - `calculate_dimensions`: Computes the optimal rectangle dimensions
   - `build_rectangle`: Creates the rectangle from normalized text
   - `encode`: Reads down columns to create the encoded output

The implementation follows the requirements:
- Normalizes input by removing spaces/punctuation and converting to lowercase
- Determines optimal rectangle dimensions where c >= r and c - r <= 1
- Builds rectangle from normalized text with padding if needed
- Encodes by reading down columns and joining chunks with spaces

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail!

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in crypto_square.h crypto_square.cpp to resolve the errors.  

I'll help fix the mismatch between the test's expected `cipher` function and our implemented `encipher` function. We need to rename the function in both files.

crypto_square.h
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::string encipher(const std::string& plaintext);
=======
std::string cipher(const std::string& plaintext);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

crypto_square.cpp
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::string encipher(const std::string& plaintext) {
=======
std::string cipher(const std::string& plaintext) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will resolve the compiler errors by matching the function name that the tests are expecting to use. The implementation logic remains the same, we're just renaming the function from `encipher` to `cipher` to match what the tests are trying to call.
