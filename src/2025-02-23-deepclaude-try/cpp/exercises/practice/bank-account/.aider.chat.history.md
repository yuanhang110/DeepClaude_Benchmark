#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.h bank_account.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the necessary modifications to implement a thread-safe bank account system:

These changes ensure that the bank account operations are thread-safe and adhere to the specified requirements. Please apply these modifications to your files.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bank_account.h bank_account.cpp to resolve the errors.  

Based on the test errors and analysis, I'll help fix the code. The main issues are:
1. Missing `open()` method that tests expect
2. `balance()` method needed instead of `get_balance()`
3. Account should start closed and be opened explicitly

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
public:
    Bankaccount();

    bool close();
    bool is_closed() const;
    bool deposit(double amount);
    bool withdraw(double amount);
    bool get_balance(double& balance) const;
=======
public:
    Bankaccount();

    bool open();
    bool close();
    bool is_closed() const;
    bool deposit(double amount);
    bool withdraw(double amount);
    double balance() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : closed(false), balance(0.0) {}
=======
Bankaccount::Bankaccount() : closed(true), balance(0.0) {}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
bool Bankaccount::is_closed() const {
=======
bool Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (!closed) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Cannot open already opened account");
    }
    closed = false;
    balance = 0.0;
    return true;
}

bool Bankaccount::is_closed() const {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
bool Bankaccount::get_balance(double& balance_out) const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (closed) {
        return false;
    }
    balance_out = balance;
    return true;
}
=======
double Bankaccount::balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (closed) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Account closed");
    }
    return balance;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Add `open()` method to explicitly open accounts
2. Make accounts start closed by default
3. Replace `get_balance()` with `balance()` that throws on closed accounts
4. Maintain thread safety with mutex locks
5. Match the test's expected behavior while preserving the core account operations
