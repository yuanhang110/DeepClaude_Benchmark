#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.  
####   
#### While you could copy/paste the lyrics, or read them from a file, this problem is much more interesting if you approach it algorithmically.  
####   
#### This is a [cumulative song][cumulative-song] of unknown origin.  
####   
#### This is one of many common variants.

I'll help you modify the FoodChain.java file to implement the song generation logic. Let me create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to update the file with the complete implementation.

FoodChain.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class FoodChain {

    String verse(int verse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

}
=======
class FoodChain {
    private static final String[] ANIMALS = {
        "fly", "spider", "bird", "cat", "dog", "goat", "cow", "horse"
    };
    
    private static final String[] COMMENTS = {
        "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.",
        "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.",
        "How absurd to swallow a bird!",
        "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!",
        "What a hog, to swallow a dog!",
        "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!",
        "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!",
        "She's dead, of course!"
    };

    String verse(int verse) {
        verse--; // Convert to 0-based index
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Special case for the last verse (horse)
        if (verse == 7) {
            return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" +
                   "She's dead, of course!\n";
        }
        
        // First line is always the same pattern
        result.append("I know an old lady who swallowed a ").append(ANIMALS[verse]).append(".\n");
        
        // Add the specific comment for this animal (if not fly)
        if (verse > 0) {
            result.append(COMMENTS[verse]).append("\n");
        }
        
        // Build the chain of swallowing
        for (int i = verse; i > 0; i--) {
            String line = "She swallowed the " + ANIMALS[i] + " to catch the " + ANIMALS[i-1];
            // Add special phrase for spider when it's the prey
            if (i - 1 == 1) {
                line += " that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her";
            }
            result.append(line).append(".\n");
        }
        
        // Always end with the fly line for verses 1-7
        result.append(COMMENTS[0]).append("\n");
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (int i = startVerse; i <= endVerse; i++) {
            result.append(verse(i));
            if (i < endVerse) {
                result.append("\n");
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Uses two arrays to store the animals and their corresponding comments
2. Handles the special case of verse 8 (horse) separately
3. For verses 1-7:
   - Starts with "I know an old lady who swallowed a [animal]"
   - Adds the specific comment for that animal (except for fly)
   - Builds the chain of animals backward, with special handling for the spider
   - Ends with the fly line
4. The verses method concatenates multiple verses with blank lines between them

The code matches the exact format shown in the example, including:
- All punctuation
- Special phrases like "wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her"
- Proper line breaks
- The special case of the horse verse

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

Looking at the error and reasoning, I agree that removing the trailing newline from the horse verse is a good first step to fix potential issues. Let me provide a SEARCH/REPLACE block to make this change:

FoodChain.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        // Special case for the last verse (horse)
        if (verse == 7) {
            return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" +
                   "She's dead, of course!\n";
        }
=======
        // Special case for the last verse (horse)
        if (verse == 7) {
            return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" +
                   "She's dead, of course!";
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the trailing newline from the horse verse, making it match the example lyrics exactly. While it's unusual for a formatting issue to cause a SIGILL error (which typically indicates a CPU instruction problem), fixing the newline handling is a good first step since it makes the output match the expected format.

Let me know if you'd like me to suggest any other changes to help resolve the JVM crash.
