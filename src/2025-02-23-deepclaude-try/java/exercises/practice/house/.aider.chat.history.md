#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the nursery rhyme 'This is the House that Jack Built'.  
####   
#### > [The] process of placing a phrase of clause within another phrase of clause is called embedding.  
#### > It is through the processes of recursion and embedding that we are able to take a finite number of forms (words and phrases) and construct an infinite number of expressions.  
#### > Furthermore, embedding also allows us to construct an infinitely long structure, in theory anyway.  
####   
#### - [papyr.com][papyr]  
####   
#### The nursery rhyme reads as follows:  
####   
#### ```text

I'll help implement the House that Jack Built nursery rhyme in Java. Based on the analysis, we need to create an array of verse parts and implement methods to build individual verses and concatenate them.

House.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class House {

    String verse(int verse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    String sing() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

}
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

class House {
    private static final String[] PARTS = {
        "the house that Jack built.",
        "the malt\nthat lay in ",
        "the rat\nthat ate ",
        "the cat\nthat killed ",
        "the dog\nthat worried ",
        "the cow with the crumpled horn\nthat tossed ",
        "the maiden all forlorn\nthat milked ",
        "the man all tattered and torn\nthat kissed ",
        "the priest all shaven and shorn\nthat married ",
        "the rooster that crowed in the morn\nthat woke ",
        "the farmer sowing his corn\nthat kept ",
        "the horse and the hound and the horn\nthat belonged to "
    };

    String verse(int verse) {
        if (verse < 1 || verse > 12) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Verse must be between 1 and 12");
        }
        
        List<String> selectedParts = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < verse; i++) {
            selectedParts.add(PARTS[i]);
        }
        Collections.reverse(selectedParts);
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("This is ");
        for (int i = 0; i < selectedParts.size(); i++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                sb.append("\n");
            }
            sb.append(selectedParts.get(i));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int v = startVerse; v <= endVerse; v++) {
            if (v > startVerse) {
                sb.append("\n\n");
            }
            sb.append(verse(v));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    String sing() {
        return verses(1, 12);
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a static array `PARTS` containing each verse segment in order
2. Implements `verse(int verse)` to build a single verse by:
   - Taking the first n parts
   - Reversing their order
   - Joining them with appropriate line breaks
3. Implements `verses(int startVerse, int endVerse)` to concatenate multiple verses with blank lines between them
4. Implements `sing()` to return all 12 verses

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in House.java to resolve the errors.  

Based on the error analysis and the reasoning that the crash might be related to accessibility issues during class loading and reflection, let's modify the House class to make it and its methods public. This should ensure proper access from test classes in other packages.

House.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class House {
=======
public class House {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

House.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verse(int verse) {
=======
    public String verse(int verse) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

House.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
=======
    public String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

House.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String sing() {
=======
    public String sing() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes make the House class and all its methods public, which should resolve any accessibility issues that might be causing problems during test execution. The implementation logic remains the same, we're just making the class and its methods properly accessible from other packages.
