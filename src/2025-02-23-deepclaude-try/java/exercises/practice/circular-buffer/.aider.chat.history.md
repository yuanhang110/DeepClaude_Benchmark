#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: CircularBuffer.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the CircularBuffer class using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks based on the reasoning provided. Let me create the blocks for each part of the implementation.



CircularBuffer.java
```java
class CircularBuffer<T> {

    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void overwrite(T data) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void clear() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

}
```

Let's implement this step by step with SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

1. First, adding the fields and implementing the constructor:

CircularBuffer.java
```
class CircularBuffer<T> {

    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    private final T[] buffer;
    private int head;
    private int tail;
    private boolean isFull;

    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        if (size <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer size must be positive");
        }
        this.buffer = (T[]) new Object[size];
        this.head = 0;
        this.tail = 0;
        this.isFull = false;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Implementing the read() method and adding the isEmpty() helper:

CircularBuffer.java
```
    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Read from empty buffer");
        }
        T data = buffer[head];
        head = (head + 1) % buffer.length;
        isFull = false;
        return data;
    }

    private boolean isEmpty() {
        return head == tail && !isFull;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. Implementing the write() method:

CircularBuffer.java
```
    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        if (isFull) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Write to full buffer");
        }
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % buffer.length;
        if (tail == head) {
            isFull = true;
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

4. Implementing the overwrite() method:

CircularBuffer.java
```
    void overwrite(T data) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    void overwrite(T data) {
        if (isFull) {
            head = (head + 1) % buffer.length;
            isFull = false;
        }
        write(data);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

5. Finally, implementing the clear() method:

CircularBuffer.java
```
    void clear() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    void clear() {
        head = 0;
        tail = 0;
        isFull = false;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will transform the CircularBuffer class into a fully functional implementation that matches the requirements. The implementation:
- Uses a circular array to store elements
- Tracks head and tail indices for reading and writing
- Uses an isFull flag to distinguish between empty and full states
- Properly handles wrapping around the buffer end
- Implements all required operations (read, write, overwrite, clear)
- Throws appropriate exceptions for invalid operations

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

I understand that the core issue is the missing BufferIOException class that's referenced in the method signatures. Let me add that class definition and then implement the CircularBuffer properly.

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class CircularBuffer<T> {
=======
class BufferIOException extends RuntimeException {
    BufferIOException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

class CircularBuffer<T> {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void overwrite(T data) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void clear() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    private final T[] buffer;
    private int readIndex = 0;
    private int writeIndex = 0;
    private int count = 0;
    
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        buffer = (T[]) new Object[size];
    }

    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        if (count == 0) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Cannot read from empty buffer");
        }
        T value = buffer[readIndex];
        readIndex = (readIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        count--;
        return value;
    }

    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        if (count == buffer.length) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Cannot write to full buffer");
        }
        buffer[writeIndex] = data;
        writeIndex = (writeIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        count++;
    }

    void overwrite(T data) {
        if (count == buffer.length) {
            readIndex = (readIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
            count--;
        }
        buffer[writeIndex] = data;
        writeIndex = (writeIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        count++;
    }

    void clear() {
        readIndex = 0;
        writeIndex = 0;
        count = 0;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Adds the missing BufferIOException class which was causing the JVM crash
2. Uses a circular array with readIndex and writeIndex to track positions
3. Maintains a count of elements to distinguish between empty and full states
4. Handles wrap-around using modulo arithmetic
5. Implements all required operations according to the specification

The key fix was adding the BufferIOException class definition, which should resolve the JVM crash you were seeing. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
