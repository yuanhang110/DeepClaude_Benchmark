#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Your parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.  
#### Confident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then start taking over the game.  
#### Needing a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.  
#### This will give you the edge to prevail over your parents!  
####   
#### [pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to translate text from English to Pig Latin.  
#### The translation is defined using four rules, which look at the pattern of vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.  
#### These rules look at each word's use of vowels and consonants:  
####   
#### - vowels: the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`  
#### - consonants: the other 21 letters of the English alphabet  
####   
#### ## Rule 1  
####   
#### If a word begins with a vowel, or starts with `"xr"` or `"yt"`, add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"apple"` -> `"appleay"` (starts with vowel)  
#### - `"xray"` -> `"xrayay"` (starts with `"xr"`)  
#### - `"yttria"` -> `"yttriaay"` (starts with `"yt"`)  
####   
#### ## Rule 2  
####   
#### If a word begins with one or more consonants, first move those consonants to the end of the word and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"pig"` -> `"igp"` -> `"igpay"` (starts with single consonant)  
#### - `"chair"` -> `"airch"` -> `"airchay"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
#### - `"thrush"` -> `"ushthr"` -> `"ushthray"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
####   
#### ## Rule 3  
####   
#### If a word starts with zero or more consonants followed by `"qu"`, first move those consonants (if any) and the `"qu"` part to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"quick"` -> `"ickqu"` -> `"ickquay"` (starts with `"qu"`, no preceding consonants)  
#### - `"square"` -> `"aresqu"` -> `"aresquay"` (starts with one consonant followed by `"qu`")  
####   
#### ## Rule 4  
####   
#### If a word starts with one or more consonants followed by `"y"`, first move the consonants preceding the `"y"`to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### Some examples:  
####   
#### - `"my"` -> `"ym"` -> `"ymay"` (starts with single consonant followed by `"y"`)  
#### - `"rhythm"` -> `"ythmrh"` -> `"ythmrhay"` (starts with multiple consonants followed by `"y"`)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: PigLatinTranslator.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Pig Latin translator based on the provided rules and reasoning. The solution will use regex patterns to identify and handle each rule in the correct order of precedence.



PigLatinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class PigLatinTranslator {
    public String translate(String word) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the translate() method");
    }

}
=======
class PigLatinTranslator {
    public String translate(String word) {
        // Rule 1: starts with vowel, xr, yt
        if (word.matches("^([aeiou]|xr|yt).*")) {
            return word + "ay";
        }

        // Rule 3: consonants (maybe none) followed by qu
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]*qu.*")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]*qu)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 4: consonants followed by y
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]+y.*")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(y.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 2: move consonants
        return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Checks Rule 1 first: if word starts with vowel or "xr"/"yt", add "ay"
2. Then Rule 3: handles words with consonants (if any) followed by "qu"
3. Then Rule 4: handles consonants followed by "y"
4. Finally Rule 2: moves any leading consonants to the end

The regex patterns handle the word splitting and rearrangement:
- `[aeiou]` matches vowels
- `[^aeiou]` matches consonants (anything not a vowel)
- `+` means one or more occurrences
- `.*` matches the rest of the word
- `$2$1` in replacements swaps the captured groups

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

Based on the reasoning provided, we should simplify the regex patterns in the matches() calls since they're redundant with the .* at the end. The replacement patterns still need to capture the full word. Let me propose those changes:

PigLatinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class PigLatinTranslator {
    public String translate(String word) {
        // Rule 1: starts with vowel, xr, yt
        if (word.matches("^([aeiou]|xr|yt).*")) {
            return word + "ay";
        }

        // Rule 3: consonants (maybe none) followed by qu
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]*qu.*")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]*qu)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 4: consonants followed by y
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]+y.*")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(y.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 2: move consonants
        return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
    }
}
=======
class PigLatinTranslator {
    public String translate(String word) {
        // Rule 1: starts with vowel, xr, yt
        if (word.matches("^([aeiou]|xr|yt)")) {
            return word + "ay";
        }

        // Rule 3: consonants (maybe none) followed by qu
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]*qu")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]*qu)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 4: consonants followed by y
        if (word.matches("^[^aeiou]+y")) {
            return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(y.*)$", "$2$1ay");
        }

        // Rule 2: move consonants
        return word.replaceAll("^([^aeiou]+)(.*)$", "$2$1ay");
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed redundant `.*` from the `matches()` patterns since matches() already requires the entire string to match
2. Kept the `.*` in the `replaceAll` patterns since we still need to capture the rest of the word
3. Left the core logic and order of rules unchanged

These changes make the regex more efficient while maintaining the same functionality. This should help avoid any potential issues with regex processing that might be causing the JVM crash.
