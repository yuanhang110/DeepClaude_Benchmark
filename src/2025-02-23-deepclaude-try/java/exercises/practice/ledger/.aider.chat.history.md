#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a ledger printer.  
####   
#### The ledger exercise is a refactoring exercise.  
#### There is code that prints a nicely formatted ledger, given a locale (American or Dutch) and a currency (US dollar or euro).  
#### The code however is rather badly written, though (somewhat surprisingly) it consistently passes the test suite.  
####   
#### Rewrite this code.  
#### Remember that in refactoring the trick is to make small steps that keep the tests passing.  
#### That way you can always quickly go back to a working version.  
#### Version control tools like git can help here as well.  
####   
#### Please keep a log of what changes you've made and make a comment on the exercise containing that log, this will help reviewers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: Ledger.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in Ledger.java to resolve the errors.  

Based on the analysis, we can refactor the code to avoid potential floating-point precision issues by changing the LedgerEntry's change field from double to int, storing amounts in cents. While the SIGILL error suggests a JVM issue, using integers for currency values is generally better practice and might help avoid triggering any edge cases.

Here are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to implement these changes:

```java
Ledger.java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        double change;

        public LocalDate getLocalDate() {
=======
        int change;

        public LocalDate getLocalDate() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```java
Ledger.java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        public double getChange() {
            return change;
        }

        public void setChange(double change) {
            this.change = change;
        }
=======
        public int getChange() {
            return change;
        }

        public void setChange(int change) {
            this.change = change;
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```java
Ledger.java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                String converted = null;
                if (e.getChange() < 0) {
                    converted = String.format("%.02f", (e.getChange() / 100) * -1);
                } else {
                    converted = String.format("%.02f", e.getChange() / 100);
                }
=======
                int change = e.getChange();
                String converted = null;
                if (change < 0) {
                    converted = String.format("%.02f", (-change) / 100.0);
                } else {
                    converted = String.format("%.02f", change / 100.0);
                }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Change the change field from double to int
2. Update getter/setter methods to use int
3. Modify the amount calculation to handle int values and convert to double during formatting

The createLedgerEntry method already takes an int parameter, so it doesn't need modification.

Would you like me to apply these changes?
