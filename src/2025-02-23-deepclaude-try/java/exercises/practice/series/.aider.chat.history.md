#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.  
####   
#### For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:  
####   
#### - "491"  
#### - "914"  
#### - "142"  
####   
#### And the following 4-digit series:  
####   
#### - "4914"  
#### - "9142"  
####   
#### And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.  
####   
#### Note that these series are only required to occupy _adjacent positions_ in the input;  
#### the digits need not be _numerically consecutive_.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: Series.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Series class based on the provided requirements. First, let me analyze what needs to be done and then provide the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

The task requires modifying Series.java to:
1. Store the input string in the constructor
2. Implement the slices method to return contiguous substrings of a given length

Here are the necessary SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

First, we need to add a field and implement the constructor:

Series.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Series(String string) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the Series(string) constructor.");
    }
=======
    private final String digits;

    Series(String string) {
        this.digits = string;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, implement the slices method:

Series.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    List<String> slices(int num) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the Series.slices() method.");
    }
=======
    List<String> slices(int num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Slice length cannot be non-positive");
        }
        if (num > digits.length()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Slice length cannot be greater than series length");
        }

        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= digits.length() - num; i++) {
            result.add(digits.substring(i, i + num));
        }
        return result;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And we need to add the ArrayList import:

Series.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:
1. Store the input string in a private final field
2. Initialize the field in the constructor
3. Implement the slices method to:
   - Validate the requested slice length
   - Create a list to store results
   - Generate all possible contiguous substrings of the requested length
   - Return the list of substrings
4. Add the necessary ArrayList import

The implementation handles all the requirements from the instructions, including proper error handling for invalid slice lengths.

#### ####  
####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in Series.java to resolve the errors.  

I understand that there's a JVM crash occurring, and since the tests are correct, we need to fix the Series.java code. The analysis indicates that the issue likely stems from not properly validating input in the constructor, particularly for null values which could cause unexpected behavior leading to native code crashes.

Let me provide a SEARCH/REPLACE block to add proper input validation:

Series.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Series(String string) {
        this.digits = string;
    }
=======
    Series(String string) {
        if (string == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Series string cannot be null");
        }
        this.digits = string;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds a null check in the constructor
2. Throws an IllegalArgumentException with a descriptive message if null is passed
3. Prevents potential NullPointerException in the slices method that could be causing the JVM crash

The rest of the code looks correct, so this single change should resolve the issue by catching invalid input early.
