#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.  
####   
#### There are some rules that your solution must follow:  
####   
#### - You can only do one action at a time.  
#### - There are only 3 possible actions:  
####   1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:  
####      a) the first bucket is empty  
####      b) the second bucket is full  
####   2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
####   3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
#### - After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the initial starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.  
####   
#### Your program will take as input:  
####   
#### - the size of bucket one  
#### - the size of bucket two  
#### - the desired number of liters to reach  
#### - which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two  
####   
#### Your program should determine:  
####   
#### - the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket  
#### - which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two  
#### - how many liters are left in the other bucket  
####   
#### Note: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.  
####   
#### Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.  
#### Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).  
#### If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.  
#### Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.  
####   
#### Another Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.  
#### You are told you must start with bucket one.  
#### So your first action is to fill bucket one.  
#### You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.  
#### For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: TwoBucket.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on the provided reasoning, I'll help implement the Two Bucket problem solution in Java. Let me create the necessary SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to modify the existing code.

This implementation:
1. Uses BFS to find the shortest sequence of moves to reach the desired amount
2. Handles all three possible actions: filling, emptying, and pouring between buckets
3. Enforces the rule that after an action, the starting bucket can't be empty while the other is full
4. Tracks visited states to avoid cycles
5. Returns the total moves, final bucket, and other bucket's amount as required

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

Based on the detailed reasoning provided, I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to modify TwoBucket.java to use ArrayDeque instead of LinkedList, since this might help avoid potential JVM issues on the aarch64 platform. While the original code seems logically correct, switching to ArrayDeque is worth trying as it's generally more efficient and might prevent whatever edge case is causing the JVM crash.

TwoBucket.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
=======
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

TwoBucket.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        Queue<State> queue = new LinkedList<>();
=======
        Queue<State> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Replaces the LinkedList import with ArrayDeque
2. Changes the queue implementation from LinkedList to ArrayDeque
3. Keeps all other logic intact since ArrayDeque implements Queue interface

Would you like me to try any other changes if this doesn't resolve the JVM crash?
