#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the scored points on a Go board.  
####   
#### In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.  
#### The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.  
####   
#### Calculate the territory of each player.  
#### You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.  
####   
#### Determine the territory which includes a specified coordinate.  
####   
#### Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.  
#### In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).  
#### Empty spaces represent empty intersections.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### +----+  
#### |IOOI|  
#### |O  O|  
#### |O OI|  
#### |IOI |  
#### +----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

I'll help implement the Go territory counting logic in Java. Let me create the necessary SEARCH/REPLACE blocks based on the reasoning.

First, let's add the necessary imports, enum, and field:

GoCounting.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.awt.Point;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

class GoCounting {
=======
import java.awt.Point;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.HashMap;

class GoCounting {
    private final Player[][] boardGrid;
    
    enum Player {
        BLACK, WHITE, NONE
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's implement the constructor:

GoCounting.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    GoCounting(String board) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    GoCounting(String board) {
        String[] rows = board.split("\n");
        boardGrid = new Player[rows.length][rows[0].length()];
        
        for (int y = 0; y < rows.length; y++) {
            String row = rows[y];
            for (int x = 0; x < row.length(); x++) {
                char c = row.charAt(x);
                if (c == 'B') {
                    boardGrid[y][x] = Player.BLACK;
                } else if (c == 'W') {
                    boardGrid[y][x] = Player.WHITE;
                } else {
                    boardGrid[y][x] = Player.NONE;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isValidPoint(int x, int y) {
        return y >= 0 && y < boardGrid.length && x >= 0 && x < boardGrid[0].length;
    }
    
    private Set<Point> getNeighbors(int x, int y) {
        Set<Point> neighbors = new HashSet<>();
        int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int newX = x + dir[0];
            int newY = y + dir[1];
            if (isValidPoint(newX, newY)) {
                neighbors.add(new Point(newX, newY));
            }
        }
        return neighbors;
    }
    
    private Map.Entry<Set<Point>, Set<Player>> calculateTerritory(int x, int y) {
        if (!isValidPoint(x, y) || boardGrid[y][x] != Player.NONE) {
            return Map.entry(Collections.emptySet(), Collections.emptySet());
        }
        
        Set<Point> territory = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Point> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Point> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        Point start = new Point(x, y);
        queue.add(start);
        visited.add(start);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Point p = queue.poll();
            territory.add(p);
            
            for (Point neighbor : getNeighbors(p.x, p.y)) {
                Player neighborPlayer = boardGrid[neighbor.y][neighbor.x];
                if (neighborPlayer == Player.NONE) {
                    if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                        visited.add(neighbor);
                        queue.add(neighbor);
                    }
                } else {
                    borderingPlayers.add(neighborPlayer);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return Map.entry(territory, borderingPlayers);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's implement the territory owner method:

GoCounting.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Player getTerritoryOwner(int x, int y) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    Player getTerritoryOwner(int x, int y) {
        var result = calculateTerritory(x, y);
        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = result.getValue();
        
        if (borderingPlayers.size() != 1) {
            return Player.NONE;
        }
        return borderingPlayers.iterator().next();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's implement the territory getter:

GoCounting.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Set<Point> getTerritory(int x, int y) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    Set<Point> getTerritory(int x, int y) {
        return calculateTerritory(x, y).getKey();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, let's implement the territories getter:

GoCounting.java
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Map<Player, Set<Point>> getTerritories() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    Map<Player, Set<Point>> getTerritories() {
        Map<Player, Set<Point>> territories = new HashMap<>();
        territories.put(Player.BLACK, new HashSet<>());
        territories.put(Player.WHITE, new HashSet<>());
        territories.put(Player.NONE, new HashSet<>());
        
        Set<Point> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int y = 0; y < boardGrid.length; y++) {
            for (int x = 0; x < boardGrid[0].length; x++) {
                if (boardGrid[y][x] == Player.NONE) {
                    Point p = new Point(x, y);
                    if (!visited.contains(p)) {
                        var result = calculateTerritory(x, y);
                        Set<Point> territory = result.getKey();
                        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = result.getValue();
                        
                        Player owner = Player.NONE;
                        if (borderingPlayers.size() == 1) {
                            owner = borderingPlayers.iterator().next();
                        }
                        
                        territories.get(owner).addAll(territory);
                        visited.addAll(territory);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return territories;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses BFS to find connected empty points and determine territory ownership
2. Handles edge cases (invalid coordinates, non-empty points)
3. Follows the rules about horizontal/vertical neighbors only
4. Correctly identifies neutral territory when both players have bordering stones
5. Returns empty sets for invalid or non-empty points
6. Efficiently calculates all territories by tracking visited points

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

I understand the issue - the SIGILL error is likely being caused by using java.awt.Point which can trigger native library loading issues. Let's replace it with a custom Point record to avoid AWT dependencies.

GoCounting.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.awt.Point;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.HashMap;

class GoCounting {
    private final Player[][] boardGrid;
    
    enum Player {
        BLACK, WHITE, NONE
    }
=======
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Collections;

class GoCounting {
    private final Player[][] boardGrid;
    
    enum Player {
        BLACK, WHITE, NONE
    }
    
    record Point(int x, int y) {}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's keep all the other code the same since our custom Point record will work as a drop-in replacement for java.awt.Point - it has the same x,y fields and proper equals/hashCode implementation since it's a record.

The key changes are:
1. Removed java.awt.Point import
2. Added java.util.Collections import (which was missing but needed for Map.entry)
3. Added custom Point record definition
4. The existing code using Point will now use our custom record instead of java.awt.Point

This should resolve the SIGILL error by removing the AWT dependency while maintaining the same functionality.
