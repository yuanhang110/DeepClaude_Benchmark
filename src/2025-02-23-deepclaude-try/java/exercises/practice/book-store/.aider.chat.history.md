#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: BookStore.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the book store discount calculation code. Based on the detailed analysis provided, we need to make two changes to the existing code:

1. Add required imports
2. Implement the calculateBasketCost method

Here are the necessary SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

BookStore.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

BookStore.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    double calculateBasketCost(List<Integer> books) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    double calculateBasketCost(List<Integer> books) {
        int[] counts = new int[5];
        for (int book : books) {
            counts[book - 1]++;
        }

        List<Integer> countsList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int count : counts) {
            countsList.add(count);
        }

        double total = 0.0;
        List<Integer> groups = new ArrayList<>();

        while (true) {
            Collections.sort(countsList, Collections.reverseOrder());

            int groupSize = 0;
            while (groupSize < 5 && countsList.get(groupSize) > 0) {
                groupSize++;
            }

            if (groupSize == 0) {
                break;
            }

            groups.add(groupSize);

            double discount = 0.0;
            switch (groupSize) {
                case 5: discount = 0.25; break;
                case 4: discount = 0.20; break;
                case 3: discount = 0.10; break;
                case 2: discount = 0.05; break;
                case 1: discount = 0.00; break;
            }

            total += groupSize * 8 * (1 - discount);

            for (int i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                countsList.set(i, countsList.get(i) - 1);
            }
        }

        int num5 = Collections.frequency(groups, 5);
        int num3 = Collections.frequency(groups, 3);
        int replacements = Math.min(num5, num3);
        total -= replacements * 0.40;

        return total;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Counts how many copies of each book are present
2. Uses a greedy approach to form the largest possible groups
3. Applies the appropriate discount for each group size
4. Handles the special case where replacing groups of 5+3 with 4+4 gives a better discount
5. Returns the total cost with maximum possible discount applied

The code matches all the test cases in the problem description, including the main example where it correctly calculates $51.20 as the optimal price for the given basket of books.

Based on the reasoning, the core issue appears to be that the BookStore class needs to be public to be properly accessible by the test framework. While the JVM crash is unusual for a visibility issue, making the class public is a good first step since it's required for proper test framework access.

Let me provide the SEARCH/REPLACE block to make this change:

BookStore.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class BookStore {
=======
public class BookStore {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change makes the BookStore class publicly accessible. While the SIGILL error is unusual for a visibility issue, starting with proper class visibility is important. We should also make the method public for consistency with testing frameworks, so let me add that change as well:

BookStore.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    double calculateBasketCost(List<Integer> books) {
=======
    public double calculateBasketCost(List<Integer> books) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure proper visibility for both the class and its method. If the JVM crash persists after these changes, we may need to explore other potential causes, but establishing proper visibility is the correct first step.
