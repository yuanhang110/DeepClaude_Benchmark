#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: KindergartenGarden.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the KindergartenGarden class based on the provided requirements. Let's break this down into a series of SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to modify the file systematically.

First, let's update the imports to include all necessary utility classes:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.*;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's add the necessary class fields and update the constructor declaration:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class KindergartenGarden {

    KindergartenGarden(String garden) {
=======
class KindergartenGarden {
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = List.of(
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    );
    
    private final Map<String, List<Plant>> plantsByStudent;
    
    KindergartenGarden(String garden) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's implement the constructor:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
=======
        String[] rows = garden.split("\n");
        String firstRow = rows[0];
        String secondRow = rows[1];
        
        plantsByStudent = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < STUDENTS.size(); i++) {
            List<Plant> plants = new ArrayList<>();
            plants.add(getPlant(firstRow.charAt(2 * i)));
            plants.add(getPlant(firstRow.charAt(2 * i + 1)));
            plants.add(getPlant(secondRow.charAt(2 * i)));
            plants.add(getPlant(secondRow.charAt(2 * i + 1)));
            plantsByStudent.put(STUDENTS.get(i), plants);
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's add the helper method for converting characters to Plant types:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    }
=======
    }
    
    private Plant getPlant(char c) {
        switch(c) {
            case 'G': return Plant.Grass;
            case 'C': return Plant.Clover;
            case 'R': return Plant.Radish;
            case 'V': return Plant.Violet;
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid plant code: " + c);
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, let's implement the getPlantsOfStudent method:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    List<Plant> getPlantsOfStudent(String student) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    List<Plant> getPlantsOfStudent(String student) {
        return plantsByStudent.getOrDefault(student, List.of());
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Maintains a list of students in alphabetical order
2. Processes the garden string by splitting it into rows
3. For each student, collects their four plants (two from each row)
4. Returns the plants for a given student when requested

The code assumes the Plant enum is defined elsewhere with values Grass, Clover, Radish, and Violet. The implementation handles the garden diagram encoding as specified in the requirements, where:
- G = Grass
- C = Clover
- R = Radish
- V = Violet

#### Fix the code in KindergartenGarden.java to resolve the errors.  

Based on the reasoning, I'll propose modifying the STUDENTS list initialization to use Arrays.asList() instead of List.of() to potentially avoid the JVM crash. Here's the change:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = List.of(
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    );
=======
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = Arrays.asList(
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change maintains the same functionality but uses a different method of creating the immutable list that might avoid potential JVM issues. Let me know if this resolves the error, and we can explore other potential fixes if needed.
