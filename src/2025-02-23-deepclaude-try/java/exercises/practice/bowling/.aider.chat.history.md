#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Score a bowling game.  
####   
#### Bowling is a game where players roll a heavy ball to knock down pins arranged in a triangle.  
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
####   
#### ## Scoring Bowling  
####   
#### The game consists of 10 frames.  
#### A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization.  
#### There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.  
####   
#### - An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame.  
####   In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### - A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second throw.  
####   The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.  
####   
#### - A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first throw.  
####   The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two throws.  
####   If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.  
####   
#### Here is a three frame example:  
####   
#### |  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |  
#### | :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |  
#### | X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |  
####   
#### Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20  
####   
#### Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19  
####   
#### Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9  
####   
#### This means the current running total is 48.  
####   
#### The tenth frame in the game is a special case.  
#### If someone throws a spare or a strike then they get one or two fill balls respectively.  
#### Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame.  
#### Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls.  
#### The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
#### It should support two operations:  
####   
#### - `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.  
####   The argument is the number of pins knocked down.  
#### - `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.  
####   It returns the total score for that game.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: BowlingGame.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.
