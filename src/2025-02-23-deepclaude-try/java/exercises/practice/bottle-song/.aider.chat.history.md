#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Recite the lyrics to that popular children's repetitive song: Ten Green Bottles.  
####   
#### Note that not all verses are identical.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Ten green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be nine green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Nine green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be eight green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Eight green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be seven green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Seven green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be six green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Six green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be five green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Five green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be four green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Four green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be three green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Three green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be two green bottles hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### Two green bottles hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be one green bottle hanging on the wall.  
####   
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### One green bottle hanging on the wall,  
#### And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,  
#### There'll be no green bottles hanging on the wall.  
#### ```

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: BottleSong.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Ten Green Bottles song in Java. Based on the detailed analysis, here's the solution:



BottleSong.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class BottleSong {

    String recite(int startBottles, int takeDown) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

}
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class BottleSong {

    String recite(int startBottles, int takeDown) {
        List<String> verses = new ArrayList<>();
        int current = startBottles;
        while (takeDown > 0 && current >= 1) {
            verses.add(generateVerse(current));
            current--;
            takeDown--;
        }
        return String.join("\n\n", verses);
    }

    private String generateVerse(int current) {
        int next = current - 1;
        String line1 = getBottleLine(current);
        String line3 = "And if one green bottle should accidentally fall,";
        String line4 = getNextLine(next);
        return String.join("\n", line1, line1, line3, line4);
    }

    private String getBottleLine(int number) {
        String countWord = numberToWord(number);
        String bottles = (number == 1) ? "bottle" : "bottles";
        return String.format("%s green %s hanging on the wall,", countWord, bottles);
    }

    private String getNextLine(int nextNumber) {
        String nextCountWord = getNextCountWord(nextNumber);
        String nextBottles = (nextNumber == 1) ? "bottle" : "bottles";
        return String.format("There'll be %s green %s hanging on the wall.", nextCountWord, nextBottles);
    }

    private String getNextCountWord(int number) {
        if (number == 0) {
            return "no";
        } else {
            return numberToWord(number).toLowerCase();
        }
    }

    private String numberToWord(int number) {
        switch (number) {
            case 10: return "Ten";
            case 9: return "Nine";
            case 8: return "Eight";
            case 7: return "Seven";
            case 6: return "Six";
            case 5: return "Five";
            case 4: return "Four";
            case 3: return "Three";
            case 2: return "Two";
            case 1: return "One";
            default: return "";
        }
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Takes `startBottles` and `takeDown` parameters to determine how many verses to generate
2. Correctly handles singular/plural for "bottle"/"bottles"
3. Converts numbers to words (capitalized for start of lines, lowercase for "next" counts)
4. Handles the special case when going to "no bottles"
5. Properly formats verses with commas and periods
6. Adds blank lines between verses but not after the last verse
7. Uses only standard Java libraries

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

#### Fix the code in BottleSong.java to resolve the errors.  

Looking at the reasoning and the error message, let's fix the access modifiers in BottleSong.java. The core issue seems to be that the class and its main method need to be public to be properly accessed by the test framework.

Here's the change:

BottleSong.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class BottleSong {

    String recite(int startBottles, int takeDown) {
=======
public class BottleSong {

    public String recite(int startBottles, int takeDown) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Makes the class public so it can be accessed from other packages
2. Makes the recite method public so it can be called by the test framework

The SIGILL error suggests a low-level issue with the JVM's native method handling, and ensuring proper class/method visibility can help avoid class loading issues that might trigger such problems.

Would you like me to try any other changes if this doesn't resolve the error?
