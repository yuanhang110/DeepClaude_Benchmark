#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.  
####   
#### The **North American Numbering Plan (NANP)** is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.  
#### All NANP-countries share the same international country code: `1`.  
####   
#### NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as _area code_, followed by a seven-digit local number.  
#### The first three digits of the local number represent the _exchange code_, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the _subscriber number_.  
####   
#### The format is usually represented as  
####   
#### ```text  
#### NXX NXX-XXXX  
#### ```  
####   
#### where `N` is any digit from 2 through 9 and `X` is any digit from 0 through 9.  
####   
#### Sometimes they also have the country code (represented as `1` or `+1`) prefixed.  
####   
#### Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code if present.  
####   
#### For example, the inputs  
####   
#### - `+1 (613)-995-0253`  
#### - `613-995-0253`  
#### - `1 613 995 0253`  
#### - `613.995.0253`  
####   
#### should all produce the output  
####   
#### `6139950253`  
####   
#### **Note:** As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: PhoneNumber.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help you implement the PhoneNumber class according to the requirements. Let's break this down into clear SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that handle phone number validation and cleaning according to NANP specifications.

PhoneNumber.java
```java
class PhoneNumber {

    private String number;

    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
        // Clean the input - remove all non-digits
        String cleaned = numberString.replaceAll("[^0-9]", "");
        
        // Handle 11-digit numbers that start with 1
        if (cleaned.length() == 11 && cleaned.startsWith("1")) {
            cleaned = cleaned.substring(1);
        }
        
        // Validate length
        if (cleaned.length() != 10) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid phone number length");
        }
        
        // Validate area code and exchange code (first and fourth digits must be 2-9)
        if (cleaned.charAt(0) < '2' || cleaned.charAt(0) > '9' ||
            cleaned.charAt(3) < '2' || cleaned.charAt(3) > '9') {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid area code or exchange code");
        }
        
        this.number = cleaned;
    }

    String getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
}
```

Let's implement this using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

PhoneNumber.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class PhoneNumber {

    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
=======
class PhoneNumber {
    private String number;

    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

PhoneNumber.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
        // Clean the input - remove all non-digits
        String cleaned = numberString.replaceAll("[^0-9]", "");
        
        // Handle 11-digit numbers that start with 1
        if (cleaned.length() == 11 && cleaned.startsWith("1")) {
            cleaned = cleaned.substring(1);
        }
        
        // Validate length
        if (cleaned.length() != 10) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid phone number length");
        }
        
        // Validate area code and exchange code (first and fourth digits must be 2-9)
        if (cleaned.charAt(0) < '2' || cleaned.charAt(0) > '9' ||
            cleaned.charAt(3) < '2' || cleaned.charAt(3) > '9') {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid area code or exchange code");
        }
        
        this.number = cleaned;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

PhoneNumber.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String getNumber() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    String getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Cleans the input by removing all non-digit characters
2. Handles numbers with country code 1 (removes it if present)
3. Validates the length (must be exactly 10 digits after cleaning)
4. Ensures area code and exchange code start with digits 2-9
5. Stores the clean number and provides access through getNumber()

The code will properly handle all the example cases provided:
- `+1 (613)-995-0253` → `6139950253`
- `613-995-0253` → `6139950253`
- `1 613 995 0253` → `6139950253`
- `613.995.0253` → `6139950253`

And will throw appropriate exceptions for invalid numbers.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in PhoneNumber.java to resolve the errors.  

Based on the detailed analysis, I'll add a null check to handle potential null inputs more gracefully. While the JVM crash might be environmental, adding proper null handling could prevent unexpected behavior.

PhoneNumber.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
        // Clean the input - remove all non-digits
        String cleaned = numberString.replaceAll("[^0-9]", "");
=======
    PhoneNumber(String numberString) {
        if (numberString == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Phone number cannot be null");
        }
        
        // Clean the input - remove all non-digits
        String cleaned = numberString.replaceAll("[^0-9]", "");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds explicit null checking before any string operations
2. Throws IllegalArgumentException with a clear message if null is provided
3. Maintains consistency with the existing exception type
4. Prevents NullPointerException that would occur when calling replaceAll on null

Would you like me to try any other approaches to resolving the issue?
