#### # Instructions  
####   
#### If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use _resistors_.  
#### For this exercise, you need to know only three things about them:  
####   
#### - Each resistor has a resistance value.  
#### - Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.  
####   To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values.  
#### - Each band acts as a digit of a number.  
####   For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.  
####   In this exercise, you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.  
####   The program will take 3 colors as input, and outputs the correct value, in ohms.  
####   The color bands are encoded as follows:  
####   
#### - black: 0  
#### - brown: 1  
#### - red: 2  
#### - orange: 3  
#### - yellow: 4  
#### - green: 5  
#### - blue: 6  
#### - violet: 7  
#### - grey: 8  
#### - white: 9  
####   
#### In Resistor Color Duo you decoded the first two colors.  
#### For instance: orange-orange got the main value `33`.  
#### The third color stands for how many zeros need to be added to the main value.  
#### The main value plus the zeros gives us a value in ohms.  
#### For the exercise it doesn't matter what ohms really are.  
#### For example:  
####   
#### - orange-orange-black would be 33 and no zeros, which becomes 33 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-red would be 33 and 2 zeros, which becomes 3300 ohms.  
#### - orange-orange-orange would be 33 and 3 zeros, which becomes 33000 ohms.  
####   
#### (If Math is your thing, you may want to think of the zeros as exponents of 10.  
#### If Math is not your thing, go with the zeros.  
#### It really is the same thing, just in plain English instead of Math lingo.)  
####   
#### This exercise is about translating the colors into a label:  
####   
#### > "... ohms"  
####   
#### So an input of `"orange", "orange", "black"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 ohms"  
####   
#### When we get to larger resistors, a [metric prefix][metric-prefix] is used to indicate a larger magnitude of ohms, such as "kiloohms".  
#### That is similar to saying "2 kilometers" instead of "2000 meters", or "2 kilograms" for "2000 grams".  
####   
#### For example, an input of `"orange", "orange", "orange"` should return:  
####   
#### > "33 kiloohms"  
####   
#### [metric-prefix]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: ResistorColorTrio.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Based on the reasoning, I'll implement the ResistorColorTrio class that calculates resistance values from color codes. Here's the required change:




```java 
class ResistorColorTrio {
    String label(String[] colors) {
        int first = colorCode(colors[0]);
        int second = colorCode(colors[1]);
        int exponent = colorCode(colors[2]);
        
        long mainValue = (first * 10L) + second;
        long multiplier = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < exponent; i++) {
            multiplier *= 10;
        }
        long totalOhms = mainValue * multiplier;
        
        if (totalOhms >= 1_000_000_000L && totalOhms % 1_000_000_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000_000_000L) + " gigaohms";
        } else if (totalOhms >= 1_000_000L && totalOhms % 1_000_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000_000L) + " megaohms";
        } else if (totalOhms >= 1_000L && totalOhms % 1_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000L) + " kiloohms";
        } else {
            return totalOhms + " ohms";
        }
    }
    
    private int colorCode(String color) {
        switch (color) {
            case "black": return 0;
            case "brown": return 1;
            case "red": return 2;
            case "orange": return 3;
            case "yellow": return 4;
            case "green": return 5;
            case "blue": return 6;
            case "violet": return 7;
            case "grey": return 8;
            case "white": return 9;
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid color: " + color);
        }
    }
}

```


The implementation:
1. Uses a helper method `colorCode` to convert colors to their numeric values
2. Calculates the main value from the first two digits
3. Computes the multiplier using a loop instead of Math.pow to avoid floating point issues
4. Determines the appropriate metric prefix by checking divisibility by powers of 1000
5. Returns the formatted string with the correct unit

This handles all the example cases correctly:
- `["orange", "orange", "black"]` → "33 ohms"  
- `["orange", "orange", "red"]` → "3300 ohms"
- `["orange", "orange", "orange"]` → "33 kiloohms"

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

Based on the extensive error analysis and reasoning, let's modify the code to use a lookup array for multipliers instead of the loop calculation. While it's unusual for a simple loop to cause a JVM crash, this alternative approach might help avoid whatever is triggering the SIGILL.

ResistorColorTrio.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class ResistorColorTrio {
    String label(String[] colors) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
}
=======
class ResistorColorTrio {
    String label(String[] colors) {
        int first = colorCode(colors[0]);
        int second = colorCode(colors[1]);
        int exponent = colorCode(colors[2]);
        
        long[] multipliers = {1L, 10L, 100L, 1000L, 10_000L, 100_000L, 1_000_000L, 10_000_000L, 100_000_000L, 1_000_000_000L};
        long mainValue = (first * 10L) + second;
        long totalOhms = mainValue * multipliers[exponent];
        
        if (totalOhms >= 1_000_000_000L && totalOhms % 1_000_000_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000_000_000L) + " gigaohms";
        } else if (totalOhms >= 1_000_000L && totalOhms % 1_000_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000_000L) + " megaohms";
        } else if (totalOhms >= 1_000L && totalOhms % 1_000L == 0) {
            return (totalOhms / 1_000L) + " kiloohms";
        } else {
            return totalOhms + " ohms";
        }
    }
    
    private int colorCode(String color) {
        switch (color) {
            case "black": return 0;
            case "brown": return 1;
            case "red": return 2;
            case "orange": return 3;
            case "yellow": return 4;
            case "green": return 5;
            case "blue": return 6;
            case "violet": return 7;
            case "grey": return 8;
            case "white": return 9;
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid color: " + color);
        }
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This revised implementation:
1. Uses a lookup array for multipliers instead of a loop
2. Maintains the same logic for calculating the main value and determining metric prefixes
3. Handles all color codes (0-9) via the switch statement
4. Uses proper long literals to avoid overflow
5. Maintains the same error handling for invalid colors

Let me know if you'd like me to try a different approach or if you're still seeing the JVM crash with these changes.
