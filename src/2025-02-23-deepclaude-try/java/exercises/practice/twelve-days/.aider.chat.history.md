#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: TwelveDays.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the "Twelve Days of Christmas" song generator in Java. Based on the provided code template and requirements, here's how we can modify the code:



TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class TwelveDays {
    String verse(int verseNumber) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
    
    String sing() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
}
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class TwelveDays {
    private static final String[] ORDINALS = {
        "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth",
        "seventh", "eighth", "ninth", "tenth", "eleventh", "twelfth"
    };

    private static final String[] GIFTS = {
        "a Partridge in a Pear Tree",
        "two Turtle Doves",
        "three French Hens",
        "four Calling Birds",
        "five Gold Rings",
        "six Geese-a-Laying",
        "seven Swans-a-Swimming",
        "eight Maids-a-Milking",
        "nine Ladies Dancing",
        "ten Lords-a-Leaping",
        "eleven Pipers Piping",
        "twelve Drummers Drumming"
    };

    String verse(int verseNumber) {
        int index = verseNumber - 1;
        String day = ORDINALS[index];

        ArrayList<String> giftsList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < verseNumber; i++) {
            giftsList.add(GIFTS[i]);
        }
        Collections.reverse(giftsList);

        String giftsString;
        if (giftsList.size() == 1) {
            giftsString = giftsList.get(0);
        } else {
            String allButLast = String.join(", ", giftsList.subList(0, giftsList.size() - 1));
            giftsString = allButLast + ", and " + giftsList.get(giftsList.size() - 1);
        }

        return String.format("On the %s day of Christmas my true love gave to me: %s.", day, giftsString);
    }

    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = startVerse; i <= endVerse; i++) {
            sb.append(verse(i));
            if (i != endVerse) {
                sb.append("\n\n");
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    String sing() {
        return verses(1, 12);
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Uses arrays to store the ordinal numbers and gifts for each day
2. Implements `verse()` to generate a single verse with proper formatting
3. Implements `verses()` to combine multiple verses with correct spacing
4. Implements `sing()` to return the complete song

The key features include:
- Proper handling of "and" before the last gift in each verse
- Correct formatting with two newlines between verses
- Maintaining the exact text formatting specified in the requirements
- Efficient string building using StringBuilder and String.join

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in TwelveDays.java to resolve the errors.  

Looking at the error and reasoning, the issue seems to be that the TwelveDays class needs to be public so it can be accessed by the tests from other packages. Let me provide the SEARCH/REPLACE block to fix this:

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class TwelveDays {
=======
public class TwelveDays {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change makes the TwelveDays class public, which should allow the tests to properly access and instantiate it, resolving the JVM crash. The rest of the implementation looks correct in terms of the song generation logic.
