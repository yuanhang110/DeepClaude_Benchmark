#### # Instructions  
####   
#### ## Chromatic Scales  
####   
#### Scales in Western music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale.  
#### This scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:  
####   
#### > A, A♯, B, C, C♯, D, D♯, E, F, F♯, G, G♯  
####   
#### A given sharp note (indicated by a ♯) can also be expressed as the flat of the note above it (indicated by a ♭) so the chromatic scale can also be written like this:  
####   
#### > A, B♭, B, C, D♭, D, E♭, E, F, G♭, G, A♭  
####   
#### The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch collection.  
#### They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.  
#### The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or flats, depending on the tonic (starting note).  
#### Here is a table indicating whether the flat expression or sharp expression of the scale would be used for a given tonic:  
####   
#### | Key Signature | Major                 | Minor                |  
#### | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |  
#### | Natural       | C                     | a                    |  
#### | Sharp         | G, D, A, E, B, F♯     | e, b, f♯, c♯, g♯, d♯ |  
#### | Flat          | F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭ | d, g, c, f, b♭, e♭   |  
####   
#### Note that by common music theory convention the natural notes "C" and "a" follow the sharps scale when ascending and the flats scale when descending.  
#### For the scope of this exercise the scale is only ascending.  
####   
#### ### Task  
####   
#### Given a tonic, generate the 12 note chromatic scale starting with the tonic.  
####   
#### - Shift the base scale appropriately so that all 12 notes are returned starting with the given tonic.  
#### - For the given tonic, determine if the scale is to be returned with flats or sharps.  
#### - Return all notes in uppercase letters (except for the `b` for flats) irrespective of the casing of the given tonic.  
####   
#### ## Diatonic Scales  
####   
#### The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the chromatic scale, are built upon intervals.  
#### An interval is the space between two pitches.  
####   
#### The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a "half step", or "minor second" (sometimes written as a lower-case "m").  
#### The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called a "whole step" or "major second" (written as an upper-case "M").  
#### The diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between adjacent notes.  
####   
#### Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.  
#### An "augmented second" interval, written "A", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or D♭ to E) or a "whole step" plus a "half step".  
#### There are also smaller and larger intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.  
####   
#### ### Task  
####   
#### Given a tonic and a set of intervals, generate the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the specified interval pattern.  
####   
#### This is similar to generating chromatic scales except that instead of returning 12 notes, you will return N+1 notes for N intervals.  
#### The first note is always the given tonic.  
#### Then, for each interval in the pattern, the next note is determined by starting from the previous note and skipping the number of notes indicated by the interval.  
####   
#### For example, starting with G and using the seven intervals MMmMMMm, there would be the following eight notes:  
####   
#### | Note | Reason                                            |  
#### | ---- | ------------------------------------------------- |  
#### | G    | Tonic                                             |  
#### | A    | M indicates a whole step from G, skipping G♯      |  
#### | B    | M indicates a whole step from A, skipping A♯      |  
#### | C    | m indicates a half step from B, skipping nothing  |  
#### | D    | M indicates a whole step from C, skipping C♯      |  
#### | E    | M indicates a whole step from D, skipping D♯      |  
#### | F♯   | M indicates a whole step from E, skipping F       |  
#### | G    | m indicates a half step from F♯, skipping nothing |  
####

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in scale_generator.go to resolve the errors.  

The issue is a duplicate "A" key in the sharpTonics map. Let's fix that and align the sharp tonics with the music theory requirements from the problem description.

scale_generator.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	sharpTonics := map[string]bool{
		"G": true, "D": true, "A": true, "E": true, "B": true, "F#": true,
		"C#": true, "G#": true, "D#": true, "C": true, "A": true,
	}
=======
	sharpTonics := map[string]bool{
		"G": true, "D": true, "A": true, "E": true, "B": true, "F#": true,
		"C#": true, "G#": true, "D#": true, "E": true, "B": true, "F#": true,
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Removes the duplicate "A" key
2. Removes the incorrect "C" entry (C is a natural scale)
3. Adds the minor sharp keys from the problem description table ("E", "B", "F#" corresponding to minor keys e, b, f♯)
4. Maintains all valid sharp key signatures for both major and minor scales
