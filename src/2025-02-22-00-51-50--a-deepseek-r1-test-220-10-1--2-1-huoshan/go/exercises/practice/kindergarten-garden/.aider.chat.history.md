#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: kindergarten_garden.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help modify the kindergarten_garden.go file to implement the garden functionality according to the requirements. Here are the key changes needed:

1. Define the Garden structure
2. Implement NewGarden with input validation and plant mapping
3. Implement Plants lookup method
4. Add helper function for plant code conversion

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package kindergarten

// Define the Garden type here.
=======
package kindergarten

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"strings"
)

type Garden struct {
	plants map[string][]string
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func NewGarden(diagram string, children []string) (*Garden, error) {
	panic("Please implement the NewGarden function")
}
=======
func NewGarden(diagram string, children []string) (*Garden, error) {
	// Clean and validate diagram format
	diagram = strings.TrimSpace(diagram)
	rows := strings.Split(diagram, "\n")
	if len(rows) != 2 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid diagram format: expected 2 rows, got %d", len(rows))
	}

	// Validate number of children matches diagram width
	expectedWidth := len(children) * 2
	if len(rows[0]) != expectedWidth || len(rows[1]) != expectedWidth {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf(
			"diagram rows must each contain exactly %d characters, got %d and %d",
			expectedWidth,
			len(rows[0]),
			len(rows[1]),
		)
	}

	// Create sorted copy and check for duplicates
	sortedChildren := make([]string, len(children))
	copy(sortedChildren, children)
	sort.Strings(sortedChildren)
	
	seen := make(map[string]bool)
	for _, name := range sortedChildren {
		if seen[name] {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("duplicate child name: %s", name)
		}
		seen[name] = true
	}

	// Build plant mapping
	plantsMap := make(map[string][]string)
	for i, name := range sortedChildren {
		// Get cups from both rows for this child
		cupsRow1 := rows[0][i*2 : i*2+2]
		cupsRow2 := rows[1][i*2 : i*2+2]

		var plants []string
		for _, c := range cupsRow1 {
			plant, err := convertToPlant(c)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid plant code in row 1: %w", err)
			}
			plants = append(plants, plant)
		}
		for _, c := range cupsRow2 {
			plant, err := convertToPlant(c)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid plant code in row 2: %w", err)
			}
			plants = append(plants, plant)
		}
		plantsMap[name] = plants
	}

	return &Garden{plants: plantsMap}, nil
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func (g *Garden) Plants(child string) ([]string, bool) {
	panic("Please implement the Plants function")
}
=======
func (g *Garden) Plants(child string) ([]string, bool) {
	plants, ok := g.plants[child]
	return plants, ok
}

func convertToPlant(c rune) (string, error) {
	switch c {
	case 'V':
		return "Violet", nil
	case 'R':
		return "Radish", nil
	case 'C':
		return "Clover", nil
	case 'G':
		return "Grass", nil
	default:
		return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid plant code: %c", c)
	}
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Validates input format and dimensions
2. Sorts children alphabetically and checks for duplicates
3. Maps each child's cups to plant names using 2 cups per row
4. Provides efficient lookup via map in Plants() method
5. Includes proper error handling for invalid inputs

The code follows Go best practices with:
- Input validation first
- Clear error messages
- Proper string handling
- Efficient map lookups
- Separation of parsing and lookup logic

#### # kindergarten [kindergarten.test]

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in kindergarten_garden.go to resolve the errors.  

The error is because we're importing the "errors" package but not using it. Let's remove that unused import:

kindergarten_garden.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"strings"
)
=======
import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"strings"
)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fixes the build error by removing the unused import while keeping all other functionality exactly the same. The code already uses fmt.Errorf for error handling which is sufficient.
