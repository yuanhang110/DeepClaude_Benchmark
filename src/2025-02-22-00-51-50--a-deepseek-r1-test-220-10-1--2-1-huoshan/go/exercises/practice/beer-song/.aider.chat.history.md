#### ## For bonus points  
####   
#### Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these  
#### are some additional things you could try:  
####   
#### * Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.  
#### * Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.  
#### * If you've removed all the duplication, do you have a lot of  
####   conditionals? Try replacing the conditionals with polymorphism, if it  
####   applies in this language. How readable is it?  
####   
#### Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this  
#### experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: beer_song.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here's the implementation of the beer song with minimal duplication while maintaining readability:

beer_song.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package beer

func Song() string {
	panic("Please implement the Song function")
}

func Verses(start, stop int) (string, error) {
	panic("Please implement the Verses function")
}

func Verse(n int) (string, error) {
	panic("Please implement the Verse function")
}
=======
package beer

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func Song() string {
	verses, _ := Verses(99, 0)
	return verses
}

func Verses(start, stop int) (string, error) {
	if start < stop {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("start must be >= stop")
	}
	if start > 99 || stop < 0 {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("verse number out of range")
	}

	var verses []string
	for n := start; n >= stop; n-- {
		v, err := Verse(n)
		if err != nil {
			return "", err
		}
		verses = append(verses, v)
	}

	return strings.Join(verses, "\n\n"), nil
}

func Verse(n int) (string, error) {
	if n < 0 || n > 99 {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("invalid verse number %d", n)
	}

	var first, second string

	switch {
	case n == 0:
		first = "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer."
		second = "Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
	case n == 1:
		first = "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer."
		second = "Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall."
	default:
		first = fmt.Sprintf("%d bottles of beer on the wall, %d bottles of beer.", n, n)
		
		remaining := n - 1
		bottles := "bottles"
		if remaining == 1 {
			bottles = "bottle"
		}
		action := "one"
		if n == 1 {
			action = "it"
		}
		
		if remaining > 0 {
			second = fmt.Sprintf("Take %s down and pass it around, %d %s of beer on the wall.", action, remaining, bottles)
		} else {
			second = "Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall."
		}
	}

	return fmt.Sprintf("%s\n%s", first, second), nil
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a switch statement to handle special cases (0 and 1 bottles)
2. Maintains clear flow control for different verse scenarios
3. Uses smart string formatting to reduce duplication
4. Properly handles pluralization through conditional checks
5. Maintains the exact structure requested by the problem statement

The code balances readability with minimal repetition by:
- Handling the 0 and 1 bottle cases explicitly
- Using default cases with calculated values for most verses
- Breaking down the verse construction into logical parts
- Using clear variable names and formatting

The error handling matches the Go idiom of returning error values while maintaining the original function signatures.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in beer_song.go to resolve the errors.  

The test failures show we're missing newline characters at the end of verses and between verse groups. Let's fix this by:

1. Adding a final newline to each verse
2. Ensuring proper newline separation between verses in groups

Here are the necessary changes:

beer_song.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s\n%s", first, second), nil
=======
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s\n%s\n", first, second), nil
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

beer_song.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	return strings.Join(verses, "\n\n"), nil
=======
	return strings.Join(verses, "\n\n") + "\n", nil
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Add a trailing newline to each individual verse output
2. Add a final newline after joining verses to match the test requirements

The modifications maintain the existing logic while properly formatting the output to match the test expectations for newline placement.
