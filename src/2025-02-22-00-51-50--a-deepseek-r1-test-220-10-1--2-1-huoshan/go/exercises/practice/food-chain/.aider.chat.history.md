#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.

I'll help implement the song generator using a data-driven approach. We'll need to:

1. Create a data structure for the animals and their relationships
2. Implement Verse() using the data structure
3. Implement Verses() and Song() using Verse()

Here are the changes:

food_chain.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package foodchain

func Verse(v int) string {
	panic("Please implement the Verse function")
}

func Verses(start, end int) string {
	panic("Please implement the Verses function")
}

func Song() string {
	panic("Please implement the Song function")
}
=======
package foodchain

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

type animal struct {
	name   string
	intro  string
	suffix string
}

var animals = []animal{
	{"fly", "I don't know why she swallowed the fly. Perhaps she'll die.", ""},
	{"spider", "It wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her.", " that wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her"},
	{"bird", "How absurd to swallow a bird!", ""},
	{"cat", "Imagine that, to swallow a cat!", ""},
	{"dog", "What a hog, to swallow a dog!", ""},
	{"goat", "Just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!", ""},
	{"cow", "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!", ""},
	{"horse", "She's dead, of course!", ""},
}

func Verse(v int) string {
	if v == 8 {
		return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" + 
			animals[7].intro + "\n"
	}

	var lines []string
	lines = append(lines, fmt.Sprintf("I know an old lady who swallowed a %s.", animals[v-1].name))
	lines = append(lines, animals[v-1].intro)

	for i := v - 1; i > 0; i-- {
		lines = append(lines, fmt.Sprintf(
			"She swallowed the %s to catch the %s%s.",
			animals[i].name,
			animals[i-1].name,
			animals[i-1].suffix,
		))
	}

	if v > 1 {
		lines = append(lines, animals[0].intro)
	}

	return strings.Join(lines, "\n") + "\n"
}

func Verses(start, end int) string {
	var verses []string
	for i := start; i <= end; i++ {
		verses = append(verses, Verse(i))
	}
	return strings.Join(verses, "\n")
}

func Song() string {
	return Verses(1, 8)
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Uses an `animal` struct to store each creature's details
2. Verse() builds the lyrics dynamically by walking the animal chain
3. Handles the special case for the horse verse
4. Uses string concatenation with proper formatting
5. Verses() and Song() build multi-verse sequences

The data structure captures the pattern variations:
- The unique intro line for each animal
- The swallowing suffix needed for the spider's description
- The final "die" line that's shared by all verses except the horse

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in food_chain.go to resolve the errors.  

The issue is that we're adding an extra newline at the end of each verse. Let's fix the Verse function by removing the trailing newline:

food_chain.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	return strings.Join(lines, "\n") + "\n"
=======
	return strings.Join(lines, "\n")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

food_chain.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" + 
			animals[7].intro + "\n"
=======
		return "I know an old lady who swallowed a horse.\n" + 
			animals[7].intro
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This removes the trailing newlines from both the horse verse and regular verses. The test failures show there was an extra blank line at the end of each verse, which these changes will resolve by only using the exact newlines needed between lines.
