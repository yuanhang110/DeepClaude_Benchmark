#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Refactor a tree building algorithm.  
####   
#### Some web-forums have a tree layout, so posts are presented as a tree.  
#### However the posts are typically stored in a database as an unsorted set of records.  
#### Thus when presenting the posts to the user the tree structure has to be reconstructed.  
####   
#### Your job will be to refactor a working but slow and ugly piece of code that implements the tree building logic for highly abstracted records.  
#### The records only contain an ID number and a parent ID number.  
#### The ID number is always between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the record list (exclusive).  
#### All records have a parent ID lower than their own ID, except for the root record, which has a parent ID that's equal to its own ID.  
####   
#### An example tree:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### root (ID: 0, parent ID: 0)  
#### |-- child1 (ID: 1, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    |-- grandchild1 (ID: 2, parent ID: 1)  
#### |    +-- grandchild2 (ID: 4, parent ID: 1)  
#### +-- child2 (ID: 3, parent ID: 0)  
#### |    +-- grandchild3 (ID: 6, parent ID: 3)  
#### +-- child3 (ID: 5, parent ID: 0)  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: tree_building.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help refactor the tree building algorithm to be more efficient. Here are the key changes needed:

1. Add error handling for invalid records
2. Use a map for O(1) node lookups during construction
3. Sort records to ensure we process parents before children
4. Validate parent-child relationships properly

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

tree_building.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package tree

type Record struct {
=======
package tree

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

type Record struct {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

tree_building.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func Build(records []Record) (*Node, error) {
	panic("Please implement the Build function")
}
=======
func Build(records []Record) (*Node, error) {
	if len(records) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("empty records")
	}

	// Sort records by ID to ensure we process parents before children
	sort.Slice(records, func(i, j int) bool {
		return records[i].ID < records[j].ID
	})

	nodes := make(map[int]*Node)
	
	for i, record := range records {
		// Validate record ID matches its index after sorting
		if i != record.ID {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("non-contiguous ID %d", record.ID)
		}

		// Validate root node
		if record.ID == 0 {
			if record.Parent != 0 {
				return nil, fmt.Errorf("root node has parent %d", record.Parent)
			}
			nodes[0] = &Node{ID: 0}
			continue
		}

		// Validate parent exists and has lower ID
		if record.Parent >= record.ID {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("node %d has invalid parent %d", record.ID, record.Parent)
		}

		parent, exists := nodes[record.Parent]
		if !exists {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("parent %d not found for node %d", record.Parent, record.ID)
		}

		// Create and append child node
		nodes[record.ID] = &Node{ID: record.ID}
		parent.Children = append(parent.Children, nodes[record.ID])
	}

	return nodes[0], nil
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key improvements in this refactored version:

1. Uses sorting to ensure we process parents before children
2. Adds comprehensive error checking for invalid data
3. Uses a map for O(1) node lookups during construction
4. Validates parent-child relationships properly
5. Maintains proper tree structure invariants
6. Returns descriptive error messages for invalid input

The algorithm now runs in O(n log n) time due to sorting (dominating the O(n) construction time) which is significantly better than the previous O(nÂ²) approach that would have required scanning all nodes for each parent lookup.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in tree_building.go to resolve the errors.  

The test failure shows that empty input should be allowed (returning nil, nil) instead of throwing an error. Let's fix that:

tree_building.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	if len(records) == 0 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("empty records")
	}
=======
	if len(records) == 0 {
		return nil, nil
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This aligns with the test expectation that empty input should return nil without an error. The rest of the validation logic for non-empty inputs remains unchanged.
