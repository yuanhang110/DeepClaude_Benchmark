#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Score a bowling game.  
####   
#### Bowling is a game where players roll a heavy ball to knock down pins arranged in a triangle.  
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
####   
#### ## Scoring Bowling  
####   
#### The game consists of 10 frames.  
#### A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization.  
#### There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.  
####   
#### - An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame.  
####   In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### - A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second throw.  
####   The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.  
####   
#### - A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first throw.  
####   The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two throws.  
####   If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.  
####   
#### Here is a three frame example:  
####   
#### |  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |  
#### | :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |  
#### | X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |  
####   
#### Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20  
####   
#### Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19  
####   
#### Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9  
####   
#### This means the current running total is 48.  
####   
#### The tenth frame in the game is a special case.  
#### If someone throws a spare or a strike then they get one or two fill balls respectively.  
#### Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame.  
#### Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls.  
#### The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
#### It should support two operations:  
####   
#### - `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.  
####   The argument is the number of pins knocked down.  
#### - `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.  
####   It returns the total score for that game.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bowling.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Let's implement the bowling game scoring with proper handling of strikes, spares, and frame tracking. We'll need to:

1. Define the Game structure to track rolls and frame state
2. Implement validation in Roll()
3. Calculate score with strike/spare bonuses in Score()

Here are the changes:

bowling.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Define the Game type here.

func NewGame() *Game {
=======
type Game struct {
	rolls        []int
	currentFrame int
	isDone       bool
}

func NewGame() *Game {
	return &Game{
		rolls:        make([]int, 0, 21),
		currentFrame: 1,
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bowling.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func (g *Game) Roll(pins int) error {
	panic("Please implement the Roll function")
=======
func (g *Game) Roll(pins int) error {
	if g.isDone {
		return fmt.Errorf("game is already complete")
	}
	if pins < 0 || pins > 10 {
		return fmt.Errorf("invalid number of pins: %d", pins)
	}

	// Validate frame rules
	if g.currentFrame < 10 {
		// Normal frame validation
		if len(g.rolls)%2 == 0 { // First roll in frame
			if pins == 10 { // Strike
				g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
				g.currentFrame++
				return nil
			}
		} else { // Second roll in frame
			if g.rolls[len(g.rolls)-1]+pins > 10 {
				return fmt.Errorf("frame total exceeds 10 pins")
			}
		}
	} else {
		// 10th frame special rules
		numRolls := len(g.rolls) - 20 // Rolls in 10th frame (0, 1, or 2)
		if numRolls == 0 {
			if pins == 10 { // Strike - get two extra rolls
				g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
				return nil
			}
		} else if numRolls == 1 {
			if g.rolls[18] == 10 { // First strike in 10th
				if pins == 10 { // Second strike
					g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
					return nil
				}
			} else { // Spare in 10th
				if pins > 10 {
					return fmt.Errorf("invalid number of pins: %d", pins)
				}
				g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
				g.isDone = true
				return nil
			}
		} else if numRolls == 2 {
			if pins > 10 {
				return fmt.Errorf("invalid number of pins: %d", pins)
			}
			g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
			g.isDone = true
			return nil
		}
	}

	g.rolls = append(g.rolls, pins)
	
	// Advance frame if needed
	if g.currentFrame < 10 && (pins == 10 || len(g.rolls)%2 == 0) {
		g.currentFrame++
	}
	
	// Check if game is complete
	if g.currentFrame == 10 && len(g.rolls) == 20 && (g.rolls[18]+g.rolls[19] < 10) {
		g.isDone = true
	}
	
	return nil
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bowling.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
func (g *Game) Score() (int, error) {
	panic("Please implement the Score function")
=======
func (g *Game) Score() (int, error) {
	if !g.isDone {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("game is not yet complete")
	}

	total := 0
	rollIndex := 0

	for frame := 1; frame <= 10; frame++ {
		if rollIndex >= len(g.rolls) {
			return 0, fmt.Errorf("invalid game state")
		}

		if frame < 10 {
			if g.rolls[rollIndex] == 10 { // Strike
				total += 10
				// Add next two rolls as bonus
				if rollIndex+1 < len(g.rolls) {
					total += g.rolls[rollIndex+1]
				}
				if rollIndex+2 < len(g.rolls) {
					total += g.rolls[rollIndex+2]
				}
				rollIndex++
			} else if rollIndex+1 < len(g.rolls) && g.rolls[rollIndex]+g.rolls[rollIndex+1] == 10 { // Spare
				total += 10
				if rollIndex+2 < len(g.rolls) {
					total += g.rolls[rollIndex+2]
				}
				rollIndex += 2
			} else { // Open frame
				total += g.rolls[rollIndex]
				if rollIndex+1 < len(g.rolls) {
					total += g.rolls[rollIndex+1]
				}
				rollIndex += 2
			}
		} else {
			// 10th frame - sum all rolls in the frame
			for i := rollIndex; i < len(g.rolls); i++ {
				total += g.rolls[i]
			}
			break
		}
	}

	return total, nil
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Tracks rolls in a slice and manages frame state
2. Validates proper pin counts and frame rules
3. Handles strike/spare bonuses correctly
4. Properly manages the 10th frame special cases
5. Ensures score can only be called when game is complete

The code follows standard bowling rules including:
- Strike bonus calculation (next two rolls)
- Spare bonus calculation (next roll)
- 10th frame handling with fill balls
- Proper validation of invalid rolls
- Frame-by-frame scoring progression

####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bowling.go to resolve the errors.  

The error is because we're using `fmt` package but haven't imported it. Let's add the import.

bowling.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package bowling

type Game struct {
=======
package bowling

import "fmt"

type Game struct {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the missing import for the `fmt` package that's used in error handling throughout the code. The import statement needs to come right after the package declaration in Go.
