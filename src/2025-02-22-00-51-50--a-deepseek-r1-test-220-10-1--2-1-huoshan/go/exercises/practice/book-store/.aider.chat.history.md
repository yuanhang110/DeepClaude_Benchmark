#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
#### # Implementation  
####   
#### Define a single Go func, Cost, which calculates the cost  
#### for a given list of books based on the defined discounts.  
####   
#### Use the following signature for func Cost:  
####   
#### ```  
#### func Cost(books []int) int  
#### ```  
#### Cost will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.  
#### For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.  
#### Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.  
####   
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book_store.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

	}
	replacements := min(fives, threes)
	total -= replacements * 40

	return total
}

func min(a, b int) int {
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}

```

This implementation:

1. Counts occurrences of each book (1-5)
2. Sorts counts in descending order to prioritize grouping
3. Forms groups greedily while adjusting counts and re-sorting
4. Calculates base cost using group discounts
5. Applies an optimization to replace 5+3 groups with cheaper 4+4 combinations
6. Uses integer math to avoid floating point precision issues

The algorithm handles the example case correctly, giving the optimal $51.20 (5120 cents) result by prioritizing 4-book groups over the initial greedy 5+3 grouping.
