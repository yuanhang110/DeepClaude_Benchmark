#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999, spell out that number in English.  
####   
#### ## Step 1  
####   
#### Handle the basic case of 0 through 99.  
####   
#### If the input to the program is `22`, then the output should be `'twenty-two'`.  
####   
#### Your program should complain loudly if given a number outside the blessed range.  
####   
#### Some good test cases for this program are:  
####   
#### - 0  
#### - 14  
#### - 50  
#### - 98  
#### - -1  
#### - 100  
####   
#### ### Extension  
####   
#### If you're on a Mac, shell out to Mac OS X's `say` program to talk out loud.  
#### If you're on Linux or Windows, eSpeakNG may be available with the command `espeak`.  
####   
#### ## Step 2  
####   
#### Implement breaking a number up into chunks of thousands.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield a list like 1, 234, 567, and 890, while the far simpler `1000` should yield just 1 and 0.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
####   
#### ## Step 3  
####   
#### Now handle inserting the appropriate scale word between those chunks.  
####   
#### So `1234567890` should yield `'1 billion 234 million 567 thousand 890'`  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
#### It's fine to stop at "trillion".  
####   
#### ## Step 4  
####   
#### Put it all together to get nothing but plain English.  
####   
#### `12345` should give `twelve thousand three hundred forty-five`.  
####   
#### The program must also report any values that are out of range.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: say.go  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the number-to-words conversion in Go. We'll need to:

1. Add validation for the input range
2. Create number word mappings
3. Implement chunk processing with scale words
4. Handle hyphenation and spacing

Here are the changes:

say.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH
package say

func Say(n int64) (string, bool) {
	panic("Please implement the Say function")
}
=======
package say

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

var ones = [...]string{
	"zero", "one", "two", "three", "four",
	"five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine",
	"ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen",
	"fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen",
}

var tens = [...]string{
	"", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty",
	"fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety",
}

var scales = [...]string{
	"", "thousand", "million", "billion",
}

func Say(n int64) (string, bool) {
	if n < 0 || n > 999_999_999_999 {
		return "", false
	}

	if n == 0 {
		return ones[0], true
	}

	var chunks []int64
	for n > 0 {
		chunks = append(chunks, n%1000)
		n /= 1000
	}

	var parts []string
	for i, chunk := range chunks {
		if chunk == 0 {
			continue
		}
		part := convertChunk(chunk)
		if i > 0 {
			part += " " + scales[i]
		}
		parts = append([]string{part}, parts...)
	}

	return strings.Join(parts, " "), true
}

func convertChunk(n int64) string {
	var parts []string
	
	if n >= 100 {
		parts = append(parts, ones[n/100]+" hundred")
		n %= 100
	}

	if n >= 20 {
		part := tens[n/10]
		if n%10 != 0 {
			part += "-" + ones[n%10]
		}
		parts = append(parts, part)
	} else if n > 0 {
		parts = append(parts, ones[n])
	}

	return strings.Join(parts, " ")
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Validates input range (0-999,999,999,999)
2. Breaks number into thousand chunks
3. Converts each chunk to words with proper scale (thousand/million/billion)
4. Handles hyphenation for numbers 21-99
5. Properly combines hundreds, tens and ones
6. Returns empty string + false for invalid inputs

Test cases:
- 0 → "zero"
- 14 → "fourteen"
- 50 → "fifty"
- 98 → "ninety-eight"
- 22 → "twenty-two"
- 12345 → "twelve thousand three hundred forty-five"
- 1234567890 → "one billion two hundred thirty-four million five hundred sixty-seven thousand eight hundred ninety"

The code uses only standard libraries and maintains the original function signature.

say.go
```go
<<<<<<< SEARCH

	"strings"
)
=======
import (
	"strings"

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The error was because we imported the "fmt" package but never used it. I removed the unused import while keeping the "strings" package import that we actually use.
