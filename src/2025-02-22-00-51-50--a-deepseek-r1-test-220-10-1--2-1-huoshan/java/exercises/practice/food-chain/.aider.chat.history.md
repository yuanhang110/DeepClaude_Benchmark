```

This implementation:
1. Uses static arrays to store the animal names, introductions, and unique actions
2. Builds verses cumulatively by working backwards through the animal chain
3. Handles the special spider action with string manipulation
4. Implements both verse() and verses() methods
5. Follows the exact lyrics structure from the problem description
6. Uses efficient string building with StringBuilder

The code maintains the original method signatures and class name while implementing the required functionality. Each verse is generated algorithmically rather than storing the full lyrics, making it easy to maintain and extend.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in FoodChain.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be related to JVM initialization rather than the code logic itself, but let's make some adjustments to follow Java conventions better and ensure proper access modifiers:

FoodChain.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class FoodChain {
=======
public class FoodChain {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

FoodChain.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verse(int number) {
=======
    public String verse(int number) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

FoodChain.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
=======
    public String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Added `public` access modifier to the class and methods to follow Java conventions for testable classes
2. Made no changes to the core logic as the error appears to be environmental (JVM crash during native method registration)

This aligns with standard Java practices for testable classes. The original SIGILL error is likely related to JVM installation or environment setup rather than the application code itself. You may want to try:

1. Reinstalling Java
2. Checking for system updates
3. Verifying the JVM installation matches your architecture (aarch64)
