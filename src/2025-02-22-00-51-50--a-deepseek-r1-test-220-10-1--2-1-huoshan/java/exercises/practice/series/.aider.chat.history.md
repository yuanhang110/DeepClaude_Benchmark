#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string in the order that they appear.  
####   
#### For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:  
####   
#### - "491"  
#### - "914"  
#### - "142"  
####   
#### And the following 4-digit series:  
####   
#### - "4914"  
#### - "9142"  
####   
#### And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.  
####   
#### Note that these series are only required to occupy _adjacent positions_ in the input;  
#### the digits need not be _numerically consecutive_.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: Series.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the needed changes to implement the series functionality:

1. Add a private field to store the input string
2. Implement the constructor to store the string
3. Implement slices() with validation and substring extraction

    }

class Series {
    private final String string;

    Series(String string) {
        this.string = string;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Series.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    List<String> slices(int num) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the Series.slices() method.");
    }

    List<String> slices(int num) {
        if (num <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Slice size must be positive.");
        }
        if (num > string.length()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Slice size cannot be greater than string length.");
        }
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= string.length() - num; i++) {
            result.add(string.substring(i, i + num));
        }
        return result;
    }

#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in Series.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be related to missing package declaration and JVM compatibility. Let's fix the Series.java file:

Series.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Series {
=======
package series;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Series {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds the proper package declaration matching the directory structure
2. Maintains all existing functionality while fixing the class loading issue

The SIGILL error typically indicates a JVM-level problem with native code execution, which in this case was likely caused by improper class loading due to missing package declaration.
