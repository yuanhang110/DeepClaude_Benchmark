#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.  
####   
#### There are some rules that your solution must follow:  
####   
#### - You can only do one action at a time.  
#### - There are only 3 possible actions:  
####   1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:  
####      a) the first bucket is empty  
####      b) the second bucket is full  
####   2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
####   3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
#### - After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the initial starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.  
####   
#### Your program will take as input:  
####   
#### - the size of bucket one  
#### - the size of bucket two  
#### - the desired number of liters to reach  
#### - which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two  
####   
#### Your program should determine:  
####   
#### - the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket  
#### - which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two  
#### - how many liters are left in the other bucket  
####   
#### Note: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.  
####   
#### Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.  
#### Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).  
#### If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.  
#### Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.  
####   
#### Another Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.  
#### You are told you must start with bucket one.  
#### So your first action is to fill bucket one.  
#### You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.  
#### For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.

I'll help implement the Two Bucket solution using BFS. Here are the step-by-step changes:

1. First add instance variables and update the constructor:
TwoBucket.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class TwoBucket {
    TwoBucket(int bucketOneCap, int bucketTwoCap, int desiredLiters, String startBucket) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the TwoBucket(int, int, int, String) constructor.");
    }
=======
class TwoBucket {
    private int bucketOneCap;
    private int bucketTwoCap;
    private int desiredLiters;
    private String startBucket;
    private int moves;
    private String finalBucket;
    private int otherLiters;

    public TwoBucket(int bucketOneCap, int bucketTwoCap, int desiredLiters, String startBucket) {
        this.bucketOneCap = bucketOneCap;
        this.bucketTwoCap = bucketTwoCap;
        this.desiredLiters = desiredLiters;
        this.startBucket = startBucket;
        this.moves = 0;
        this.finalBucket = "";
        this.otherLiters = 0;
        
        solve();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Add the BFS solution logic:
TwoBucket.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    int getTotalMoves() {
=======
    private void solve() {
        // Check if initial fill meets the desired liters
        int initialB1 = startBucket.equals("one") ? bucketOneCap : 0;
        int initialB2 = startBucket.equals("two") ? bucketTwoCap : 0;
        moves = 1;
        
        if (initialB1 == desiredLiters) {
            finalBucket = "one";
            otherLiters = initialB2;
            return;
        } else if (initialB2 == desiredLiters) {
            finalBucket = "two";
            otherLiters = initialB1;
            return;
        }
        
        java.util.Queue<int[]> queue = new java.util.LinkedList<>();
        java.util.Set<String> visited = new java.util.HashSet<>();
        queue.add(new int[]{initialB1, initialB2, 1});
        visited.add(initialB1 + "," + initialB2);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int b1 = current[0];
            int b2 = current[1];
            int currentMoves = current[2];
            
            java.util.List<int[]> nextStates = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
            
            // Generate all possible next states
            nextStates.add(new int[]{0, b2, currentMoves + 1}); // Empty b1
            nextStates.add(new int[]{b1, 0, currentMoves + 1}); // Empty b2
            nextStates.add(new int[]{bucketOneCap, b2, currentMoves + 1}); // Fill b1
            nextStates.add(new int[]{b1, bucketTwoCap, currentMoves + 1}); // Fill b2
            
            // Pour b1 to b2
            int pourAmount = Math.min(b1, bucketTwoCap - b2);
            nextStates.add(new int[]{b1 - pourAmount, b2 + pourAmount, currentMoves + 1});
            
            // Pour b2 to b1
            pourAmount = Math.min(b2, bucketOneCap - b1);
            nextStates.add(new int[]{b1 + pourAmount, b2 - pourAmount, currentMoves + 1});
            
            for (int[] state : nextStates) {
                int newB1 = state[0];
                int newB2 = state[1];
                int newMoves = state[2];
                String stateKey = newB1 + "," + newB2;
                
                // Check if state is invalid (starting bucket empty and other full)
                boolean invalid = false;
                if (startBucket.equals("one")) {
                    if (newB1 == 0 && newB2 == bucketTwoCap) invalid = true;
                } else {
                    if (newB2 == 0 && newB1 == bucketOneCap) invalid = true;
                }
                
                if (invalid || visited.contains(stateKey)) continue;
                
                // Check if desired liters found
                if (newB1 == desiredLiters) {
                    moves = newMoves;
                    finalBucket = "one";
                    otherLiters = newB2;
                    return;
                } else if (newB2 == desiredLiters) {
                    moves = newMoves;
                    finalBucket = "two";
                    otherLiters = newB1;
                    return;
                }
                
                visited.add(stateKey);
                queue.add(state);
            }
        }
        
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No solution possible");
    }

    int getTotalMoves() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

3. Update the getter methods to return the calculated values:
TwoBucket.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    int getTotalMoves() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the TwoBucket.getTotalMoves() method.");
    }

    String getFinalBucket() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the TwoBucket.getFinalBucket() method.");
    }

    int getOtherBucket() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the TwoBucket.getOtherBucket() method.");
    }
=======
    int getTotalMoves() {
        return moves;
    }

    String getFinalBucket() {
        return finalBucket;
    }

    int getOtherBucket() {
        return otherLiters;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses BFS to explore all possible bucket states
2. Tracks visited states to avoid cycles
3. Enforces the rule about not leaving the starting bucket empty while the other is full
4. Handles all valid operations (fill, empty, pour)
5. Returns the required metrics via the existing getter methods

The BFS ensures we find the minimum number of moves required to reach the desired liter amount. Each state transition is tracked with the number of moves, and we immediately return when we find the solution.

I notice the crash happens in JVM native code, which suggests there might be an issue with the BFS queue implementation. Let's modify the queue initialization to use ArrayDeque instead of LinkedList for better memory efficiency:

TwoBucket.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        java.util.Queue<int[]> queue = new java.util.LinkedList<>();
=======
        java.util.Queue<int[]> queue = new java.util.ArrayDeque<>();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Uses ArrayDeque instead of LinkedList for the BFS queue
2. Maintains the exact same algorithm logic but with more memory-efficient queue implementation
3. Should be more stable with large state spaces due to better memory locality

ArrayDeque is generally preferred over LinkedList for queue operations in Java as it has better memory characteristics and cache performance, which might help avoid triggering low-level JVM issues.
