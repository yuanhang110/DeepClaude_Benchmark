#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Note that mathematically, the denominator can't be zero.  
#### However in many implementations of rational numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.  
#### In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.  
####   
#### The sum of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ + r₂ = a₁/b₁ + a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The difference of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ - r₂ = a₁/b₁ - a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ * r₂ = (a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### Dividing a rational number `r₁ = a₁/b₁` by another `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ / r₂ = (a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)` if `a₂` is not zero.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,  
#### - absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.  
####   
#### Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.  
#### For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.  
#### To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.  
#### So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.  
#### The reduced form of a rational number should be in "standard form" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).  
#### If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.  
#### For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`  
####   
#### Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: Rational.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Rational number class according to the specifications. Let's break this down into steps:

1. Add private fields to store numerator/denominator
2. Implement constructor with GCD reduction and sign handling
3. Implement arithmetic operations using mathematical formulas
4. Implement exponentiation and absolute value
5. Keep existing equals/hashCode/toString since they're already correct

Here are the changes:

The implementation:
1. Stores numbers in reduced form with positive denominator using GCD
2. Uses mathematical formulas for rational number operations
3. Handles positive/negative exponents correctly
4. Maintains immutability with final fields
5. Uses existing equals/hashCode/toString which work with the stored reduced form

The constructor handles:
- Reduction via GCD
- Sign normalization
- Zero denominator validation

Let me know if you need any clarification about the implementation choices!

The error appears to be related to native code interaction. Let's modify the gcd implementation to use an iterative approach instead of recursive, which might be causing issues with the JVM's native code handling:

Rational.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        a = Math.abs(a);
        b = Math.abs(b);
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
=======
    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        a = Math.abs(a);
        b = Math.abs(b);
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Replaces recursive implementation with iterative version to avoid potential stack overflow/native code interaction issues
2. Maintains the same gcd calculation logic using Euclidean algorithm
3. Still properly handles negative numbers through Math.abs()

The crash in System.registerNatives() suggests there may be an issue with the JVM's native code initialization, and recursive calls during class initialization might be contributing to this. The iterative approach is more JVM-friendly for low-level mathematical operations.

Let me know if you still see any errors and I can suggest additional troubleshooting steps.
