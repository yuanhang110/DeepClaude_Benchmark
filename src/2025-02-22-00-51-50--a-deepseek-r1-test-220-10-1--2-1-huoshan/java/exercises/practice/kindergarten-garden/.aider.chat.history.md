#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants.  
#### The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt.  
#### To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup.  
#### The children got to pick their favorites from four available types of seeds: grass, clover, radishes, and violets.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to, given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.  
####   
#### There are 12 children in the class:  
####   
#### - Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.  
####   
#### Four different types of seeds are planted:  
####   
#### | Plant  | Diagram encoding |  
#### | ------ | ---------------- |  
#### | Grass  | G                |  
#### | Clover | C                |  
#### | Radish | R                |  
#### | Violet | V                |  
####   
#### Each child gets four cups, two on each row:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### ........................ # each dot represents a cup  
#### ........................  
#### ```  
####   
#### Their teacher assigns cups to the children alphabetically by their names, which means that Alice comes first and Larry comes last.  
####   
#### Here is an example diagram representing Alice's plants:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VR......................  
#### RG......................  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  
#### In the second row she has a radish and some grass.  
####   
#### Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the windows.  
#### From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to each student.  
####   
#### For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [window][window][window]  
#### VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV  
#### VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:  
####   
#### - Violets, radishes, violets, radishes  
####   
#### While asking for Bob's plants would yield:  
####   
#### - Clover, grass, clover, clover  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: KindergartenGarden.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Let's implement the KindergartenGarden solution step by step:

1. Add required imports
2. Create a student list in order
3. Parse garden rows and map plants to students
4. Implement plant lookup

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class KindergartenGarden {

    KindergartenGarden(String garden) {
=======
class KindergartenGarden {
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = List.of(
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    );
    
    private final Map<String, List<Plant>> plantsMap = new HashMap<>();

    KindergartenGarden(String garden) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
=======
        String[] rows = garden.split("\n");
        if (rows.length != 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Garden must have exactly two rows");
        }
        
        List<String> row1Chunks = splitRow(rows[0]);
        List<String> row2Chunks = splitRow(rows[1]);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < STUDENTS.size(); i++) {
            String student = STUDENTS.get(i);
            String plantsStr = row1Chunks.get(i) + row2Chunks.get(i);
            List<Plant> plants = new ArrayList<>();
            for (char c : plantsStr.toCharArray()) {
                plants.add(Plant.fromCode(c));
            }
            plantsMap.put(student, plants);
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    List<Plant> getPlantsOfStudent(String student) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
=======
    List<Plant> getPlantsOfStudent(String student) {
        return plantsMap.getOrDefault(student, Collections.emptyList());
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}
=======
    }

    private List<String> splitRow(String row) {
        List<String> chunks = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < row.length(); i += 2) {
            int end = Math.min(i + 2, row.length());
            chunks.add(row.substring(i, end));
        }
        return chunks;
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Splits the garden string into two rows
2. Divides each row into chunks of two characters per student
3. Combines the corresponding chunks from both rows for each student
4. Maps the characters to Plant enums (assuming Plant.fromCode exists)
5. Returns the plant list for any given student

The solution handles all edge cases specified in the problem statement and follows the required alphabetical ordering of students.

There's an extra closing brace that's causing a syntax error. Let's fix the class structure:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    }

    private List<String> splitRow(String row) {
=======
    private List<String> splitRow(String row) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This removes the extra closing brace that was appearing between the `getPlantsOfStudent()` method and the `splitRow()` method. The Java class should only have one closing brace at the very end of the file to close the class definition.

#### Fix the code in KindergartenGarden.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be related to Java version compatibility with the `List.of()` factory method. Let's modify the code to use a compatible approach for initializing the STUDENTS list:

KindergartenGarden.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = List.of(
        "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
        "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
        "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
    );
=======
    private static final List<String> STUDENTS = Collections.unmodifiableList(
        Arrays.asList(
            "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David",
            "Eve", "Fred", "Ginny", "Harriet",
            "Ileana", "Joseph", "Kincaid", "Larry"
        )
    );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the Java 9+ `List.of()` with the more compatible `Arrays.asList()` wrapped in an unmodifiable list, which should work across Java versions while maintaining the same functionality.
