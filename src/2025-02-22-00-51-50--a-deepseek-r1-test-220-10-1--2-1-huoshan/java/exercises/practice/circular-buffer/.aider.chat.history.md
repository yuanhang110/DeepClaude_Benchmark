#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: CircularBuffer.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the circular buffer according to the specifications. We need to:

1. Add internal storage and state tracking
2. Implement buffer operations with proper circular wrapping
3. Handle full/empty states and exceptions

Here are the changes:

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class CircularBuffer<T> {

    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
class CircularBuffer<T> {
    private final Object[] buffer;
    private final int capacity;
    private int head;
    private int tail;
    private boolean isFull;

    CircularBuffer(final int size) {
        this.capacity = size;
        this.buffer = new Object[size];
        this.head = 0;
        this.tail = 0;
        this.isFull = false;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void overwrite(T data) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    void clear() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    T read() throws BufferIOException {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Tried to read from empty buffer");
        }
        
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        T data = (T) buffer[head];
        head = (head + 1) % capacity;
        isFull = false;
        return data;
    }

    void write(T data) throws BufferIOException {
        if (isFull) {
            throw new BufferIOException("Tried to write to full buffer");
        }
        
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
        isFull = tail == head;
    }

    void overwrite(T data) {
        if (isFull) {
            head = (head + 1) % capacity;
        }
        
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
        isFull = tail == head;
    }

    void clear() {
        head = 0;
        tail = 0;
        isFull = false;
    }

    private boolean isEmpty() {
        return !isFull && head == tail;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes:
1. Added internal array storage and state variables (head, tail, isFull)
2. Implemented circular pointer logic using modulo arithmetic
3. Added proper error handling for buffer full/empty cases
4. Implemented overwrite behavior that replaces oldest elements when full
5. Added helper method to check empty state
6. Used type erasure-compatible casting for generic array

The buffer follows all specified behavior:
- Normal writes fail when full
- Overwrites replace oldest elements when full
- Reads remove oldest elements
- Clear resets the buffer state
- Pointers wrap around using modulo arithmetic
- Full/empty states are properly tracked

The error appears to be related to the modulo operations. Let's modify the pointer increment logic to use explicit checks instead of modulo operations, which might resolve the low-level arithmetic issue:

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        head = (head + 1) % capacity;
=======
        head++;
        if (head == capacity) {
            head = 0;
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
=======
        tail++;
        if (tail == capacity) {
            tail = 0;
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

CircularBuffer.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        isFull = tail == head;
=======
        isFull = (tail == head);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Replace modulo operations with explicit pointer wrapping checks
2. Maintain the exact same buffer behavior but with different arithmetic operations
3. Keep the full/empty state tracking identical

The logic remains functionally equivalent but uses different arithmetic that might avoid triggering the low-level runtime error.
