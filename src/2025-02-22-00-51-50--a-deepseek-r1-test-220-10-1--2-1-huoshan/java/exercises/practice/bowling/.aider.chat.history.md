#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Score a bowling game.  
####   
#### Bowling is a game where players roll a heavy ball to knock down pins arranged in a triangle.  
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
####   
#### ## Scoring Bowling  
####   
#### The game consists of 10 frames.  
#### A frame is composed of one or two ball throws with 10 pins standing at frame initialization.  
#### There are three cases for the tabulation of a frame.  
####   
#### - An open frame is where a score of less than 10 is recorded for the frame.  
####   In this case the score for the frame is the number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### - A spare is where all ten pins are knocked down by the second throw.  
####   The total value of a spare is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in their next throw.  
####   
#### - A strike is where all ten pins are knocked down by the first throw.  
####   The total value of a strike is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two throws.  
####   If a strike is immediately followed by a second strike, then the value of the first strike cannot be determined until the ball is thrown one more time.  
####   
#### Here is a three frame example:  
####   
#### |  Frame 1   |  Frame 2   |     Frame 3      |  
#### | :--------: | :--------: | :--------------: |  
#### | X (strike) | 5/ (spare) | 9 0 (open frame) |  
####   
#### Frame 1 is (10 + 5 + 5) = 20  
####   
#### Frame 2 is (5 + 5 + 9) = 19  
####   
#### Frame 3 is (9 + 0) = 9  
####   
#### This means the current running total is 48.  
####   
#### The tenth frame in the game is a special case.  
#### If someone throws a spare or a strike then they get one or two fill balls respectively.  
#### Fill balls exist to calculate the total of the 10th frame.  
#### Scoring a strike or spare on the fill ball does not give the player more fill balls.  
#### The total value of the 10th frame is the total number of pins knocked down.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of X1/ (strike and a spare), the total value is 20.  
####   
#### For a tenth frame of XXX (three strikes), the total value is 30.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling.  
#### It should support two operations:  
####   
#### - `roll(pins : int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball.  
####   The argument is the number of pins knocked down.  
#### - `score() : int` is called only at the very end of the game.  
####   It returns the total score for that game.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: BowlingGame.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

BowlingGame.java

class BowlingGame {

    void roll(int pins) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

    int score() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }

}
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;

class BowlingGame {
    private ArrayList<Integer> rolls = new ArrayList<>();

    void roll(int pins) {
        rolls.add(pins);
    }

    int score() {
        int total = 0;
        int currentRoll = 0;
        
        for (int frame = 0; frame < 10; frame++) {
            if (isStrike(currentRoll)) {
                total += 10 + strikeBonus(currentRoll);
                currentRoll++;
            } else if (isSpare(currentRoll)) {
                total += 10 + spareBonus(currentRoll);
                currentRoll += 2;
            } else {
                total += sumOfRollsInFrame(currentRoll);
                currentRoll += 2;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }

    private boolean isStrike(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private boolean isSpare(int rollIndex) {
        return sumOfRollsInFrame(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private int strikeBonus(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex + 1) + rolls.get(rollIndex + 2);
    }

    private int spareBonus(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex + 2);
    }

    private int sumOfRollsInFrame(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex) + rolls.get(rollIndex + 1);
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Uses an ArrayList to store all rolls
2. Scores each frame by checking for strikes and spares
3. Handles bonus points for strikes/spares by looking ahead in the rolls list
4. Properly handles the 10th frame special cases through the iteration limit
5. Follows standard bowling scoring rules including strike/spare bonuses

The code maintains the original class structure and method signatures while adding private helper methods for scoring logic.

#### Fix the code in BowlingGame.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be caused by index out-of-bounds exceptions in the bonus calculations. Let's fix the helper methods to properly handle frame boundaries and avoid invalid array accesses:

BowlingGame.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    private boolean isStrike(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private boolean isSpare(int rollIndex) {
        return sumOfRollsInFrame(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private int strikeBonus(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex + 1) + rolls.get(rollIndex + 2);
    }

    private int spareBonus(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex + 2);
    }

    private int sumOfRollsInFrame(int rollIndex) {
        return rolls.get(rollIndex) + rolls.get(rollIndex + 1);
    }
=======
    private boolean isStrike(int rollIndex) {
        return rollIndex < rolls.size() && rolls.get(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private boolean isSpare(int rollIndex) {
        return rollIndex + 1 < rolls.size() && sumOfRollsInFrame(rollIndex) == 10;
    }

    private int strikeBonus(int rollIndex) {
        int bonus = 0;
        if (rollIndex + 1 < rolls.size()) bonus += rolls.get(rollIndex + 1);
        if (rollIndex + 2 < rolls.size()) bonus += rolls.get(rollIndex + 2);
        return bonus;
    }

    private int spareBonus(int rollIndex) {
        return (rollIndex + 2 < rolls.size()) ? rolls.get(rollIndex + 2) : 0;
    }

    private int sumOfRollsInFrame(int rollIndex) {
        int sum = rolls.get(rollIndex);
        if (rollIndex + 1 < rolls.size()) sum += rolls.get(rollIndex + 1);
        return sum;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Added bounds checking before all array accesses
2. Gracefully handle missing bonus rolls by returning 0 when they don't exist
3. Fixed the spare/strike detection to first verify valid indexes
4. Properly handles the 10th frame special cases implicitly through bounds checks

This should prevent the JVM crashes caused by invalid memory accesses while maintaining correct bowling scoring rules.
