#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the scored points on a Go board.  
####   
#### In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.  
#### The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.  
####   
#### Calculate the territory of each player.  
#### You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.  
####   
#### Determine the territory which includes a specified coordinate.  
####   
#### Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.  
#### In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).  
#### Empty spaces represent empty intersections.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### +----+  
#### |IOOI|  
#### |O  O|  
#### |O OI|  
#### |IOI |  
#### +----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

```

This implementation:

1. Parses the board string into a 2D grid in the constructor
2. Uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore territories
3. Tracks edge contact and bordering players during BFS
4. Determines territory ownership based on surrounding stones
5. Returns immutable results through unmodifiable collections
6. Uses an EnumMap for efficient player-based territory grouping
7. Handles coordinate validation and edge cases

The solution follows Go territory rules where:
- Empty intersections completely surrounded by one player's stones count as that player's territory
- Territories touching the edge or multiple players are considered neutral (NONE)
- Occupied points are never considered part of any territory

The error appears to be related to using `java.awt.Point` which may have issues with the ARM64 architecture environment. Let's replace it with a simple custom position class:

GoCounting.java
```java

GoCounting.java

        TerritoryData data = calculateTerritory(x, y);
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(data.territory);
=======
    Set<Position> getTerritory(int x, int y) {
        TerritoryData data = calculateTerritory(x, y);
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(data.territory.stream()
            .map(p -> new Position(p.x, p.y))
            .collect(Collectors.toSet()));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

                    for (Position p : data.territory) {

```

        final Set<Position> territory;
        final Player owner;

=======
        Set<Position> territory = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Position> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];

GoCounting.java
```java

GoCounting.java

                        queue.add(new Position(nx, ny));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Remove the dependency on java.awt.Point
2. Use a simple Position record instead
3. Update all type references to use the new Position class
4. Add proper stream mapping for the territory set conversion

This should avoid the native library conflict while maintaining the same functionality. The Position record will work similarly to Point but with pure Java code that doesn't rely on AWT internals.

Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from GoCounting.java?

```
            return new TerritoryData(Collections.emptySet(), Player.NONE);
        }
        
        Set<Point> territory = new HashSet<>();
        boolean edgeFound = false;
        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Point> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        
        queue.add(new Point(x, y));
        visited[y][x] = true;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Position p = queue.poll();
            territory.add(p);
```

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

# The other 8 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  

GoCounting.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        Set<Point> territory = new HashSet<>();
        boolean edgeFound = false;
        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Point> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        
        queue.add(new Point(x, y));
=======
        Set<Position> territory = new HashSet<>();
        boolean edgeFound = false;
        Set<Player> borderingPlayers = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Position> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        
        queue.add(new Position(x, y));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `Set<Point>` to `Set<Position>`
2. Changed `Queue<Point>` to `Queue<Position>`
3. Changed `new Point(x, y)` to `new Position(x, y)`

This matches the exact existing code structure while replacing the remaining Point references with Position in the calculateTerritory() method.
