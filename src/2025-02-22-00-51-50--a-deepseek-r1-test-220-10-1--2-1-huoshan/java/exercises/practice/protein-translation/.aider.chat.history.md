#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Translate RNA sequences into proteins.  
####   
#### RNA can be broken into three-nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a protein like so:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCU"` => translates to  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU"`  
#### => which become a protein with the following sequence =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  
#### If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.  
#### However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.  
####   
#### There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.  
####   
#### All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:  
####   
#### RNA: `"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG"` =>  
####   
#### Codons: `"AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAA", "AUG"` =>  
####   
#### Protein: `"Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"`  
####   
#### Note the stop codon `"UAA"` terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.  
####   
#### Below are the codons and resulting amino acids needed for the exercise.  
####   
#### | Codon              | Amino Acid    |  
#### | :----------------- | :------------ |  
#### | AUG                | Methionine    |  
#### | UUU, UUC           | Phenylalanine |  
#### | UUA, UUG           | Leucine       |  
#### | UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG | Serine        |  
#### | UAU, UAC           | Tyrosine      |  
#### | UGU, UGC           | Cysteine      |  
#### | UGG                | Tryptophan    |  
#### | UAA, UAG, UGA      | STOP          |

I'll help implement the protein translation logic. We need to:

1. Create a codon to amino acid mapping
2. Split the RNA sequence into 3-character codons
3. Translate until encountering a STOP codon

Here are the changes:

ProteinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import java.util.List;
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

ProteinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class ProteinTranslator {

    List<String> translate(String rnaSequence) {
=======
class ProteinTranslator {
    private static final Map<String, String> codonMap = new HashMap<>();

    static {
        codonMap.put("AUG", "Methionine");
        codonMap.put("UUU", "Phenylalanine");
        codonMap.put("UUC", "Phenylalanine");
        codonMap.put("UUA", "Leucine");
        codonMap.put("UUG", "Leucine");
        codonMap.put("UCU", "Serine");
        codonMap.put("UCC", "Serine");
        codonMap.put("UCA", "Serine");
        codonMap.put("UCG", "Serine");
        codonMap.put("UAU", "Tyrosine");
        codonMap.put("UAC", "Tyrosine");
        codonMap.put("UGU", "Cysteine");
        codonMap.put("UGC", "Cysteine");
        codonMap.put("UGG", "Tryptophan");
        codonMap.put("UAA", "STOP");
        codonMap.put("UAG", "STOP");
        codonMap.put("UGA", "STOP");
    }

    List<String> translate(String rnaSequence) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

ProteinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
=======
        List<String> proteins = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rnaSequence.length(); i += 3) {
            String codon = rnaSequence.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, rnaSequence.length()));
            String aminoAcid = codonMap.get(codon);
            if (aminoAcid == null || "STOP".equals(aminoAcid)) {
                break;
            }
            proteins.add(aminoAcid);
        }
        return proteins;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a static map of all codons and their translations
2. Splits the RNA string into 3-character codons
3. Translates until hitting a STOP codon or invalid input
4. Returns the list of translated proteins

The code handles edge cases like:
- STOP codons terminating translation
- Case where input length isn't a multiple of 3 (using Math.min)
- Invalid codons stopping translation (per problem constraints)

#### Fix the code in ProteinTranslator.java to resolve the errors.  

The error suggests there's an issue with how we're handling the RNA sequence processing. The main problem is that we're allowing incomplete codons (less than 3 characters) to be processed. Let's fix the codon extraction logic:

ProteinTranslator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for (int i = 0; i < rnaSequence.length(); i += 3) {
            String codon = rnaSequence.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, rnaSequence.length()));
=======
        for (int i = 0; i <= rnaSequence.length() - 3; i += 3) {
            String codon = rnaSequence.substring(i, i + 3);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Only processes complete codons of exactly 3 characters
2. Avoids partial codons at the end of the sequence
3. Uses exact substring extraction without Math.min

The error occurred because we were potentially creating invalid codon strings (with length < 3) which could lead to unexpected behavior. The new loop condition ensures we only process complete codons.
