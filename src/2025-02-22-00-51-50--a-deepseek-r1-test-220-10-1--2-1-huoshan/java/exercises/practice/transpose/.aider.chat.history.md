#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an input text output it transposed.  
####   
#### Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### is given by:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### CF  
#### ```  
####   
#### Rows become columns and columns become rows.  
#### See [transpose][].  
####   
#### If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:  
####   
#### - Pad to the left with spaces.  
#### - Don't pad to the right.  
####   
#### Therefore, transposing this matrix:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ABC  
#### DE  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
#### C  
#### ```  
####   
#### And transposing:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AB  
#### DEF  
#### ```  
####   
#### results in:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### AD  
#### BE  
####  F  
#### ```  
####   
#### In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.  
#### That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s), the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

Transpose.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public String transpose(String toTranspose) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Please implement the Transpose.transpose() method.");
    }
=======
    public String transpose(String toTranspose) {
        if (toTranspose.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        }
        
        String[] lines = toTranspose.split("\n");
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (String line : lines) {
            if (line.length() > maxLen) {
                maxLen = line.length();
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int col = 0; col < maxLen; col++) {
            StringBuilder transposedRow = new StringBuilder();
            for (String line : lines) {
                if (col < line.length()) {
                    transposedRow.append(line.charAt(col));
                } else {
                    transposedRow.append(' ');
                }
            }
            // Trim trailing spaces
            String row = transposedRow.toString().replaceAll(" +$", "");
            if (result.length() > 0) {
                result.append('\n');
            }
            result.append(row);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Handles empty input case immediately
2. Splits input into lines and finds maximum line length
3. For each column index (transposed row):
   - Builds a row by collecting characters from each original line at that index
   - Pads with spaces when lines are too short
   - Trims trailing spaces from the resulting row
4. Joins all transposed rows with newlines

This handles all the edge cases specified:
- Rows become columns with proper left-padding for uneven lengths
- Trailing spaces are removed to avoid right-padding
- All original characters are preserved in their correct positions
- Handles empty input and various length combinations

Transpose.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            StringBuilder transposedRow = new StringBuilder();
            for (String line : lines) {
                if (col < line.length()) {
                    transposedRow.append(line.charAt(col));
                } else {
                    transposedRow.append(' ');
                }
            }
            // Trim trailing spaces
            String row = transposedRow.toString().replaceAll(" +$", "");
=======
            StringBuilder transposedRow = new StringBuilder();
            int lastNonPaddingIndex = -1;
            for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
                String line = lines[i];
                if (col < line.length()) {
                    char c = line.charAt(col);
                    transposedRow.append(c);
                    // Track last original character (even spaces) that's not padding
                    lastNonPaddingIndex = transposedRow.length() - 1;
                } else {
                    transposedRow.append(' ');
                }
            }
            // Trim only trailing padding spaces
            String row = lastNonPaddingIndex >= 0 
                ? transposedRow.substring(0, lastNonPaddingIndex + 1)
                : "";
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key change is:
1. Track the last index of any character that came from an actual line (even if it's a space)
2. Only trim trailing padding spaces (those added when lines were too short) while preserving original trailing spaces
3. Use substring instead of regex to avoid accidentally removing legitimate spaces from the input

This maintains all original characters while properly handling the padding rules specified in the problem statement.
