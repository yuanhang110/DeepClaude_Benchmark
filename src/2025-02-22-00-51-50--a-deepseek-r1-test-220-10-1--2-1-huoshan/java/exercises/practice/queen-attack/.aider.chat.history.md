#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####

#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the queen attack validation. We need to:

1. Add row/column validation in Queen constructor
2. Implement attack calculation logic in QueenAttackCalculator
3. Add same-position validation in constructor

Here are the changes:

Queen.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Queen(int row, int column) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    private final int row;
    private final int column;
    
    Queen(int row, int column) {
        if (row < 0 || row >= 8 || column < 0 || column >= 8) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid position");
        }
        this.row = row;
        this.column = column;
    }
    
    public int getRow() { return row; }
    public int getColumn() { return column; }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

QueenAttackCalculator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    QueenAttackCalculator(Queen queen1, Queen queen2) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    private final Queen queen1;
    private final Queen queen2;
    
    QueenAttackCalculator(Queen queen1, Queen queen2) {
        if (queen1.getRow() == queen2.getRow() && queen1.getColumn() == queen2.getColumn()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Queens cannot occupy the same position");
        }
        this.queen1 = queen1;
        this.queen2 = queen2;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

QueenAttackCalculator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    boolean canQueensAttackOneAnother() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    boolean canQueensAttackOneAnother() {
        int q1Row = queen1.getRow();
        int q1Col = queen1.getColumn();
        int q2Row = queen2.getRow();
        int q2Col = queen2.getColumn();
        
        // Same row or column
        if (q1Row == q2Row || q1Col == q2Col) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Diagonal check (absolute difference between rows equals difference between columns)
        return Math.abs(q1Row - q2Row) == Math.abs(q1Col - q2Col);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Queen class now validates position is within 0-7 range and stores coordinates
2. Added getters for queen positions
3. Calculator constructor validates queens aren't in same position
4. Implemented attack logic checking same row, column, or diagonal
5. Used standard chessboard size of 8x8 as specified

#### Fix the code in QueenAttackCalculator.java Queen.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be related to missing public access modifiers needed for the classes and methods to be visible. Here are the necessary fixes:

Queen.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Queen {
=======
public class Queen {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

QueenAttackCalculator.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class QueenAttackCalculator {
=======
public class QueenAttackCalculator {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure proper visibility of the classes since they need to be accessible across package boundaries (likely required by the test framework). The SIGILL error typically indicates an invalid instruction, but in this context it's likely a secondary effect of the JVM failing to properly load/verify the class structure due to accessibility issues.
