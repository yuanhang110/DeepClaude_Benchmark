#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to implement a program that determines the state of a [tic-tac-toe][] game.  
#### (_You may also know the game as "noughts and crosses" or "Xs and Os"._)  
####   
#### The game is played on a 3Ã—3 grid.  
#### Players take turns to place `X`s and `O`s on the grid.  
#### The game ends when one player has won by placing three of marks in a row, column, or along a diagonal of the grid, or when the entire grid is filled up.  
####   
#### In this exercise, we will assume that `X` starts.  
####   
#### It's your job to determine which state a given game is in.  
####   
#### There are 3 potential game states:  
####   
#### - The game is **ongoing**.  
#### - The game ended in a **draw**.  
#### - The game ended in a **win**.  
####   
#### If the given board is invalid, throw an appropriate error.  
####   
#### If a board meets the following conditions, it is invalid:  
####   
#### - The given board cannot be reached when turns are taken in the correct order (remember that `X` starts).  
#### - The game was played after it already ended.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### ### Ongoing game

####   
#### ### Invalid  
####   
#### #### Wrong turn order  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  O | O | X  
#### ___|___|___

####    |   |  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
#### ```  
####   
#### #### Continued playing after win  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  X | X | X  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |

        }
        
        // Determine final state
        return (xCount + oCount) == 9 ? GameState.DRAW : GameState.ONGOING;

```

This implementation:
1. Counts X and O marks to validate turn order
2. Checks for wins using row/column/diagonal patterns
3. Validates game rules (no multiple winners, no continued play after win)
4. Returns appropriate GameState (WIN, DRAW, or ONGOING)
5. Throws descriptive exceptions for invalid board states

The error messages match the problem description's invalid cases:
- "Invalid turn order" for wrong player sequence
- "Multiple winners" when both players have winning lines
- "Game continued after X/O win" when moves exist after a win
- Implicit validation of X starting first through the count checks

#### Fix the code in StateOfTicTacToe.java to resolve the errors.  

The error indicates a missing GameState enum that's referenced in the code but not defined. Let's add the enum definition:

StateOfTicTacToe.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class StateOfTicTacToe {
=======
enum GameState {
    WIN, DRAW, ONGOING
}

class StateOfTicTacToe {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fatal error was occurring because the GameState enum was referenced in the code but not defined. Adding the enum definition resolves this missing dependency that was causing the JVM to crash.
