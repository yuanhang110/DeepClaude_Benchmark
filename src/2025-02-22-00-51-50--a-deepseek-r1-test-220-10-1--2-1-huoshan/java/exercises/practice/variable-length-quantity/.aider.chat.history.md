#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: VariableLengthQuantity.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the VLQ encoding and decoding. Let's modify the Java class with proper implementations.

                num >>>= 7;
            } while (num != 0);
            
            Collections.reverse(chunks);
            
            for (int i = 0; i < chunks.size(); i++) {
                long chunk = chunks.get(i);
                if (i != chunks.size() - 1) {
                    chunk |= 0x80;
                }
                result.add(String.format("%02X", chunk));
            }

        long current = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (Long b : bytes) {
            if (b < 0 || b > 0xFF) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid byte value");
            }
            
            current = (current << 7) | (b & 0x7F);
            count++;
            
            if ((b & 0x80) == 0) {
                if (count > 5 || (count == 5 && current > 0xFFFF_FFFFL >>> 7)) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Overflow 32-bit unsigned");
                }

                current = 0;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        
        if (count > 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Incomplete sequence");
        }
        
        return result;
    }

```

The changes include:

1. Added proper imports for ArrayList and Collections
2. Implemented encode() with:
   - Validation of 32-bit range
   - Chunking into 7-bit segments
   - Setting high bit for continuation bytes
   - Conversion to hex strings
3. Implemented decode() with:
   - Validation of byte values
   - Proper bit shifting and accumulation
   - Overflow checking
   - Incomplete sequence detection
   - Conversion to 8-digit hex strings

The implementation follows the VLQ specification by:
- Using high bit (0x80) to mark continuation bytes
- Handling zero as a special case
- Using unsigned right shift (>>>) for proper 32-bit handling
- Validating input ranges and complete sequences
- Producing the required hexadecimal string format from the examples

#### Fix the code in VariableLengthQuantity.java to resolve the errors.  

Let's fix the overflow check in the decode method. The issue is in the calculation for 32-bit overflow validation:

VariableLengthQuantity.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if (count > 5 || (count == 5 && current > 0xFFFF_FFFFL >>> 7)) {
=======
                if (count > 5 || (count == 5 && current > 0xFFFF_FFFFL)) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The original code was using an incorrect bit mask (`>>> 7`) when checking for 32-bit overflow with 5-byte sequences. This change properly validates against the maximum 32-bit unsigned integer value (0xFFFFFFFF) directly.

This matches the problem description's requirement to handle 32-bit unsigned integers while properly detecting overflow cases. The crash was occurring because some valid 5-byte encodings were being incorrectly rejected as overflow due to the incorrect bit mask.
