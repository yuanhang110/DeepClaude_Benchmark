#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task in this exercise is to write code that returns the lyrics of the song: "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
####   
#### "The Twelve Days of Christmas" is a common English Christmas carol.  
#### Each subsequent verse of the song builds on the previous verse.  
####   
#### The lyrics your code returns should _exactly_ match the full song text shown below.  
####   
#### ## Lyrics  
####   
#### ```text  
#### On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me: a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me: two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me: three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

####   
#### On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the ninth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me: eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.  
####   
#### On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: twelve Drummers Drumming, eleven Pipers Piping, ten Lords-a-Leaping, nine Ladies Dancing, eight Maids-a-Milking, seven Swans-a-Swimming, six Geese-a-Laying, five Gold Rings, four Calling Birds, three French Hens, two Turtle Doves, and a Partridge in a Pear Tree.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: TwelveDays.java  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the TwelveDays class to generate the song lyrics. We'll need to:

1. Add arrays for the day/gift data
2. Implement verse() to build each verse
3. Implement verses() to combine multiple verses
4. Implement sing() to return the full song

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class TwelveDays {
=======
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class TwelveDays {
    private static final String[] days = {
        "first", "second", "third", "fourth", "fifth", "sixth",
        "seventh", "eighth", "ninth", "tenth", "eleventh", "twelfth"
    };

    private static final String[] gifts = {
        "a Partridge in a Pear Tree",
        "two Turtle Doves",
        "three French Hens",
        "four Calling Birds",
        "five Gold Rings",
        "six Geese-a-Laying",
        "seven Swans-a-Swimming",
        "eight Maids-a-Milking",
        "nine Ladies Dancing",
        "ten Lords-a-Leaping",
        "eleven Pipers Piping",
        "twelve Drummers Drumming"
    };

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verse(int verseNumber) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    String verse(int verseNumber) {
        String day = days[verseNumber - 1];
        List<String> giftsList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Build gifts list in reverse order (current day to first day)
        for (int i = verseNumber - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            giftsList.add(gifts[i]);
        }
        
        // Join gifts with proper formatting
        String giftsString;
        if (verseNumber == 1) {
            giftsString = giftsList.get(0);
        } else {
            String allButLast = String.join(", ", giftsList.subList(0, giftsList.size() - 1));
            giftsString = allButLast + ", and " + giftsList.get(giftsList.size() - 1);
        }
        
        return String.format("On the %s day of Christmas my true love gave to me: %s.\n", day, giftsString);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
    
    String sing() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Delete this statement and write your own implementation.");
    }
=======
    String verses(int startVerse, int endVerse) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = startVerse; i <= endVerse; i++) {
            sb.append(verse(i));
            if (i != endVerse) {
                sb.append("\n");
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    String sing() {
        return verses(1, 12);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Uses static arrays for the days and gifts data
2. verse() builds each verse by accumulating gifts in reverse order
3. verses() combines verses with proper newline separation
4. sing() returns the full song by combining all verses
5. Handles the "and" before the last gift correctly
6. Matches the exact punctuation and formatting from the problem statement

Each verse is built by:
- Looking up the day string from the days array
- Collecting all gifts up to and including the current day
- Properly formatting the gifts list with commas and "and"
- Using String.format to create the final verse string

#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in TwelveDays.java to resolve the errors.  

The error appears to be related to line endings formatting. Let's modify the verse formatting to use proper newline handling:

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return String.format("On the %s day of Christmas my true love gave to me: %s.\n", day, giftsString);
=======
        return String.format("On the %s day of Christmas my true love gave to me: %s.%n", day, giftsString);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

TwelveDays.java
```java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            sb.append("\n");
=======
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Use `%n` in String.format() instead of `\n` to get platform-specific line separators
2. Use System.lineSeparator() instead of hardcoded `\n` for verse separators

This should resolve the native formatting issues while maintaining the correct lyric structure. The `%n` format specifier will automatically use the appropriate line ending for the execution environment.
