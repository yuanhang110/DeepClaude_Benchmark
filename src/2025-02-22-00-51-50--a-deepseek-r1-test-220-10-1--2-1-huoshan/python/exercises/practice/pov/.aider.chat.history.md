#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Reparent a tree on a selected node.  
####   
#### A [tree][wiki-tree] is a special type of [graph][wiki-graph] where all nodes are connected but there are no cycles.  
#### That means, there is exactly one path to get from one node to another for any pair of nodes.  
####   
#### This exercise is all about re-orientating a tree to see things from a different point of view.  
#### For example family trees are usually presented from the ancestor's perspective:  
####   
#### ```text  
####     +------0------+  
####     |      |      |  
####   +-1-+  +-2-+  +-3-+  
####   |   |  |   |  |   |  
####   4   5  6   7  8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### But there is no inherent direction in a tree.  
#### The same information can be presented from the perspective of any other node in the tree, by pulling it up to the root and dragging its relationships along with it.  
#### So the same tree from 6's perspective would look like:  
####   
#### ```text  
####         6  
####         |  
####   +-----2-----+  
####   |           |  
####   7     +-----0-----+  
####         |           |  
####       +-1-+       +-3-+  
####       |   |       |   |  
####       4   5       8   9  
#### ```  
####   
#### This lets us more simply describe the paths between two nodes.  
#### So for example the path from 6-9 (which in the first tree goes up to the root and then down to a different leaf node) can be seen to follow the path 6-2-0-3-9.  
####   
#### This exercise involves taking an input tree and re-orientating it from the point of view of one of the nodes.

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" multiple `ValueErrors` if the `Tree()` class is passed a tree that cannot be reoriented, or a path cannot be found between a `start node` and an `end node`.   
#### The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the expected `exception` type and include the expected message with it.  
####   
#### Please check the tests and their expected results carefully.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pov.py  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

This implementation:

1. Adds helper methods:
   - `_find_node` to search for a node by label using DFS
   - `_clone` to create a deep copy of the tree
   - `_find_path` to find a path from self to target label using BFS

2. Implements `from_pov`:
   - Creates a cloned tree to avoid modifying the original
   - Finds the target node and validates its existence
   - Finds the path from root to target using BFS
   - Reparents nodes along the path to make target the new root

3. Implements `path_to`:
   - Uses `from_pov` to reorient the tree
   - Finds path in the reoriented tree using BFS
   - Properly handles error cases with meaningful messages

The code maintains the original tree structure by working on cloned nodes and properly handles error cases as specified in the problem statement.

pov.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Reorient tree from from_node's perspective
        try:
            reoriented = self.from_pov(from_node)
        except ValueError as e:
            raise ValueError("No path found") from e
=======
        # Reorient tree from from_node's perspective
        reoriented = self.from_pov(from_node)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The error occurred because we were catching the ValueError from `from_pov()` and re-raising with a different message. The test expects the original "Tree could not be reoriented" message when the source node doesn't exist. By removing the try/except block, we let the original exception propagate with its correct message.

The rest of the error handling remains in place to catch cases where:
1. The target node doesn't exist in the reoriented tree
2. There's no path between valid nodes
