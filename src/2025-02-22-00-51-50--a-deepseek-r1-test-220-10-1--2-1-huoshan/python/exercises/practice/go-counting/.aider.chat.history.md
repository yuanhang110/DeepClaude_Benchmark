#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Count the scored points on a Go board.  
####   
#### In the game of go (also known as baduk, igo, cờ vây and wéiqí) points are gained by completely encircling empty intersections with your stones.  
#### The encircled intersections of a player are known as its territory.  
####   
#### Calculate the territory of each player.  
#### You may assume that any stones that have been stranded in enemy territory have already been taken off the board.  
####   
#### Determine the territory which includes a specified coordinate.  
####   
#### Multiple empty intersections may be encircled at once and for encircling only horizontal and vertical neighbors count.  
#### In the following diagram the stones which matter are marked "O" and the stones that don't are marked "I" (ignored).  
#### Empty spaces represent empty intersections.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### +----+  
#### |IOOI|  
#### |O  O|  
#### |O OI|  
#### |IOI |  
#### +----+  
#### ```  
####   
#### To be more precise an empty intersection is part of a player's territory if all of its neighbors are either stones of that player or empty intersections that are part of that player's territory.

#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` when given invalid coordinates. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # when the coordinates for the piece are invalid  
#### raise ValueError('Invalid coordinate')  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: go_counting.py  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

Here are the changes to implement Go territory counting with proper error handling:

```

The implementation:
1. Validates coordinates and raises ValueError with proper messages
2. Uses BFS to find connected territories starting from a coordinate
3. Checks surrounding stones to determine territory ownership
4. Processes the entire board to find all territories
5. Handles edge cases like empty boards and neutral territories

The code follows Go rules where:
- Only horizontal/vertical neighbors are considered
- Territory must be completely enclosed by stones of one player
- Returns coordinates as (x,y) tuples in sets
- Empty intersections with mixed or no surrounding stones are considered neutral ("")

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in go_counting.py to resolve the errors.  

I notice the tests are trying to import WHITE, BLACK, and EMPTY constants that are missing from the code. Let's add those constants at the top of the file.

go_counting.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Board:
=======
WHITE = 'W'
BLACK = 'B'
EMPTY = ' '

class Board:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the missing constants that the tests expect to be available. The values match the stone representations we're already using in the code ('W' and 'B' for players, ' ' for empty spaces).
