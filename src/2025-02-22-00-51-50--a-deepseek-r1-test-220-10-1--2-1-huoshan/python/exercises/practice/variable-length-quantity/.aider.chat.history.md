#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Implement variable length quantity encoding and decoding.  
####   
#### The goal of this exercise is to implement [VLQ][vlq] encoding/decoding.  
####   
#### In short, the goal of this encoding is to encode integer values in a way that would save bytes.  
#### Only the first 7 bits of each byte are significant (right-justified; sort of like an ASCII byte).  
#### So, if you have a 32-bit value, you have to unpack it into a series of 7-bit bytes.  
#### Of course, you will have a variable number of bytes depending upon your integer.  
#### To indicate which is the last byte of the series, you leave bit #7 clear.  
#### In all of the preceding bytes, you set bit #7.  
####   
#### So, if an integer is between `0-127`, it can be represented as one byte.  
#### Although VLQ can deal with numbers of arbitrary sizes, for this exercise we will restrict ourselves to only numbers that fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer.  
#### Here are examples of integers as 32-bit values, and the variable length quantities that they translate to:  
####   
#### ```text  
####  NUMBER        VARIABLE QUANTITY  
#### 00000000              00  
#### 00000040              40  
#### 0000007F              7F  
#### 00000080             81 00  
#### 00002000             C0 00  
#### 00003FFF             FF 7F  
#### 00004000           81 80 00  
#### 00100000           C0 80 00  
#### 001FFFFF           FF FF 7F  
#### 00200000          81 80 80 00  
#### 08000000          C0 80 80 00  
#### 0FFFFFFF          FF FF FF 7F  
#### ```

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### ## Exception messages  
####   
#### Sometimes it is necessary to [raise an exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions). When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. For situations where you know that the error source will be a certain type, you can choose to raise one of the [built in error types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes), but should still include a meaningful message.  
####   
#### This particular exercise requires that you use the [raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement) to "throw" a `ValueError` if the sequence to decode or encode is incomplete. The tests will only pass if you both `raise` the `exception` and include a message with it.  
####   
#### To raise a `ValueError` with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### # if the sequence is incomplete  
#### raise ValueError("incomplete sequence")  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: variable_length_quantity.py  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

This implementation:

1. For encode():
- Validates input numbers are within 32-bit unsigned range
- Splits numbers into 7-bit chunks (LSB first)
- Reverses chunks to get MSB first in the byte stream
- Sets the 8th bit on all but the last chunk
- Handles zero as a special case

2. For decode():
- Collects bytes until one with the 8th bit unset is found (marks end of value)
- Reconstructs numbers from 7-bit chunks
- Validates numbers fit in 32-bit unsigned range
- Checks for incomplete sequences at end of input
- Raises ValueErrors with appropriate messages for invalid cases

The implementation matches the examples from the problem statement and handles all edge cases around 32-bit boundaries and incomplete sequences.
