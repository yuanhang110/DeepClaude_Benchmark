#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Your parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.  
#### Confident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then start taking over the game.  
#### Needing a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.  
#### This will give you the edge to prevail over your parents!  
####   
#### [pig-latin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to translate text from English to Pig Latin.  
#### The translation is defined using four rules, which look at the pattern of vowels and consonants at the beginning of a word.  
#### These rules look at each word's use of vowels and consonants:  
####   
#### - vowels: the letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`  
#### - consonants: the other 21 letters of the English alphabet  
####   
#### ## Rule 1  
####   
#### If a word begins with a vowel, or starts with `"xr"` or `"yt"`, add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"apple"` -> `"appleay"` (starts with vowel)  
#### - `"xray"` -> `"xrayay"` (starts with `"xr"`)  
#### - `"yttria"` -> `"yttriaay"` (starts with `"yt"`)  
####   
#### ## Rule 2  
####   
#### If a word begins with one or more consonants, first move those consonants to the end of the word and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"pig"` -> `"igp"` -> `"igpay"` (starts with single consonant)  
#### - `"chair"` -> `"airch"` -> `"airchay"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
#### - `"thrush"` -> `"ushthr"` -> `"ushthray"` (starts with multiple consonants)  
####   
#### ## Rule 3  
####   
#### If a word starts with zero or more consonants followed by `"qu"`, first move those consonants (if any) and the `"qu"` part to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### - `"quick"` -> `"ickqu"` -> `"ickquay"` (starts with `"qu"`, no preceding consonants)  
#### - `"square"` -> `"aresqu"` -> `"aresquay"` (starts with one consonant followed by `"qu`")  
####   
#### ## Rule 4  
####   
#### If a word starts with one or more consonants followed by `"y"`, first move the consonants preceding the `"y"`to the end of the word, and then add an `"ay"` sound to the end of the word.  
####   
#### Some examples:  
####   
#### - `"my"` -> `"ym"` -> `"ymay"` (starts with single consonant followed by `"y"`)  
#### - `"rhythm"` -> `"ythmrh"` -> `"ythmrhay"` (starts with multiple consonants followed by `"y"`)  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: pig_latin.py  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

This implementation:
1. Checks Rule 1 first for vowel sounds (including xr/yt special cases)
2. Handles Rule 3 for 'qu' sequences with preceding consonants
3. Handles Rule 4 for 'y' after consonants
4. Falls back to Rule 2 for regular consonant clusters
5. Properly handles edge cases like words with no vowels

The code follows all the rules while maintaining the original function signature and using only standard library features. The helper functions are nested inside translate() to keep the implementation self-contained.
