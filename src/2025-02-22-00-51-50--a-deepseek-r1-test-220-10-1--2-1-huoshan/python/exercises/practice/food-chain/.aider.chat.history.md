>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a data structure for each animal with its unique lyrics components
2. Builds verses cumulatively by chaining swallowing actions backwards from current animal
3. Handles the special horse case separately
4. Maintains the proper verse separators with blank lines
5. Uses only standard Python features and no external dependencies

The code follows the exact pattern shown in the problem description, generating verses algorithmically rather than just storing static text. Each verse builds the swallowing chain dynamically based on the verse number.
