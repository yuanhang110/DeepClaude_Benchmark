This implementation:

1. Creates a helper function `generate_verse` that handles all the special cases:
   - Pluralization ("bottle" vs "bottles")
   - The "no more" case when there are 0 bottles left
   - The "Go to the store" verse when there are no bottles left
   - Correct pronouns ("it" vs "one")

2. The main `recite` function:
   - Generates the requested number of verses using modulo 100 to handle wrap-around
   - Joins verses with newlines to maintain proper spacing between them
   - Splits into individual lines to match the required output format

The solution handles all edge cases including:
- 99-3 bottles (regular verses)
- 2 bottles -> 1 bottle
- 1 bottle -> no more bottles
- 0 bottles -> 99 bottles (store verse)
- Proper pluralization throughout
- Correct line spacing between verses
