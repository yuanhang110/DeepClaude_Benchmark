#### # Introduction  
####   
#### Before the `Promise` class was introduced, there was only one way to deal with asynchronous code : the _callback pattern_.  
####   
#### A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and will be called once some action in that other function has finished. A common pattern for those callback functions is that they accept an "error" as first parameter (see example below).  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### function callback(error, arg2, arg3) {}  
#### ```  
####   
#### How is it related to asynchronous code ?  
####   
#### Historically, callbacks have been used in order to allow us to do some work after an asynchronous task was done and without blocking the whole program.  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### fetchProduct(productId, function (error, data) {  
####   if (error) {  
####     // Handle the error  
####   } else {  
####     // Do some work  
####   }  
#### });  
#### ```  
####   
#### In the example above, the `fetchProduct` function (which is asynchronous), takes a callback as a second argument that decides what to do when the product data has been retrieved.  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The two objectives of this exercise are :  
####   
#### 1. Implement a `promisify` function that turns a function using the "callback pattern" into a function that returns a `Promise`. See the example below.  
####   
#### ```javascript  
#### function fetchProduct(productId, function(error, data) {  
####     if (error) {  
####         // Handle the error  
####     } else {  
####         // Make something with your data  
####     }  
#### })  
####   
#### const fetchProductAsPromise = promisify(fetchProduct);  
####   
#### // Now you got a function `fetchProductAsPromise`  
#### // that returns a promise  
#### fetchProductAsPromise(productId)  
####     .then((data) => {})  
####     .catch((error) => {});  
#### ```  
####   
#### 2. Re-implement the following built-ins `Promise` methods (without using them)  
####   
#### - `all`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them are resolved, or rejects when _one_ of them rejects.  
#### - `allSettled`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _all_ of them either resolve or reject.  
#### - `race`: takes an array of promises and resolves or rejects with the value of the _first_ promise that resolves or rejects.  
#### - `any`: takes an array of promises and resolves when _one_ of them resolves, or rejects when _all_ of them reject.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: promises.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

The implementations:
1. `promisify` - Wraps a callback-style function to return a Promise, handling the error-first callback pattern
2. `all` - Waits for all promises to resolve or rejects immediately on first rejection
3. `allSettled` - Waits for all promises to settle and returns their outcomes
4. `race` - Returns the first settled promise (either resolve or reject)
5. `any` - Returns first resolved promise or rejects with AggregateError if all reject

All implementations:
- Follow the original Promise methods behavior
- Handle edge cases like empty arrays appropriately
- Use only standard Promise constructor and basic Promise handling
- Don't use the built-in methods they're supposed to reimplement

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in promises.js to resolve the errors.  

Let's fix the error handling for when functions are called without arguments and adjust the implementations to match test expectations:

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const all = (promises) => {
=======
export const all = (promises = []) => {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const allSettled = (promises) => {
=======
export const allSettled = (promises = []) => {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const race = (promises) => {
=======
export const race = (promises = []) => {
  if (promises.length === 0) {
    return Promise.resolve([]);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const any = (promises) => {
=======
export const any = (promises = []) => {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

promises.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      reject(new AggregateError(errors, 'All promises were rejected'));
=======
      reject(new AggregateError(errors.filter(e => e !== undefined), 'All promises were rejected'));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:

1. Add default empty array parameters to handle undefined arguments
2. Fix race() to immediately resolve with empty array when given no promises
3. Fix any() to properly filter out undefined errors in AggregateError
4. Handle edge cases where functions are called without arguments

The error you're seeing in allSettled is because the tests expect the raw values but the implementation correctly follows the Promise.allSettled spec by returning status objects. However, since the tests are considered correct per your instruction, we would need to see the test code to understand why there's a mismatch between expected and actual results.
