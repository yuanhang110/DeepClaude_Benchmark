```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const recite = () => {
=======
export const recite = (startVerse, endVerse) => {
  // Handle default parameters
  if (typeof startVerse === 'undefined') {
    startVerse = 1;
    endVerse = 12;
  } else if (typeof endVerse === 'undefined') {
    endVerse = startVerse;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

twelve-days.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  for (let day = 1; day <= 12; day++) {
=======
  for (let day = startVerse; day <= endVerse; day++) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

twelve-days.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    verses.push(`On the ${ordinal} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ${giftsList}.`);
=======
    verses.push(`On the ${ordinal} day of Christmas my true love gave to me: ${giftsList}.\n`);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Add parameters to handle verse ranges
2. Properly handle default parameters for full song vs single verse vs verse ranges
3. Add required newline at end of each verse
4. Iterate only through requested verse range instead of all 12 verses

The test failures were because:
- The original implementation always returned all 12 verses
- It was missing the trailing newline (`\n`) after each verse
- It didn't support verse range parameters

The revised version properly handles single verses and verse ranges while maintaining the correct newline formatting between verses.
