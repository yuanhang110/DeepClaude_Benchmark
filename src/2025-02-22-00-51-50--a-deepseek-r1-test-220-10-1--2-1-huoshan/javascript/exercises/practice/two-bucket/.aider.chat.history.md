#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given two buckets of different size and which bucket to fill first, determine how many actions are required to measure an exact number of liters by strategically transferring fluid between the buckets.  
####   
#### There are some rules that your solution must follow:  
####   
#### - You can only do one action at a time.  
#### - There are only 3 possible actions:  
####   1. Pouring one bucket into the other bucket until either:  
####      a) the first bucket is empty  
####      b) the second bucket is full  
####   2. Emptying a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
####   3. Filling a bucket and doing nothing to the other.  
#### - After an action, you may not arrive at a state where the initial starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.  
####   
#### Your program will take as input:  
####   
#### - the size of bucket one  
#### - the size of bucket two  
#### - the desired number of liters to reach  
#### - which bucket to fill first, either bucket one or bucket two  
####   
#### Your program should determine:  
####   
#### - the total number of actions it should take to reach the desired number of liters, including the first fill of the starting bucket  
#### - which bucket should end up with the desired number of liters - either bucket one or bucket two  
#### - how many liters are left in the other bucket  
####   
#### Note: any time a change is made to either or both buckets counts as one (1) action.  
####   
#### Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold up to 7 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 11 liters.  
#### Let's say at a given step, bucket one is holding 7 liters and bucket two is holding 8 liters (7,8).  
#### If you empty bucket one and make no change to bucket two, leaving you with 0 liters and 8 liters respectively (0,8), that counts as one action.  
#### Instead, if you had poured from bucket one into bucket two until bucket two was full, resulting in 4 liters in bucket one and 11 liters in bucket two (4,11), that would also only count as one action.  
####   
#### Another Example:  
#### Bucket one can hold 3 liters, and bucket two can hold up to 5 liters.  
#### You are told you must start with bucket one.  
#### So your first action is to fill bucket one.  
#### You choose to empty bucket one for your second action.  
#### For your third action, you may not fill bucket two, because this violates the third rule -- you may not end up in a state after any action where the starting bucket is empty and the other bucket is full.

#### # Instructions.append  
####   
#### ## Output format  
####   
#### The `solve()` method is expected to return an object with these properties:  
####   
#### - `moves` - the number of bucket actions required to reach the goal  
####   (includes filling the start bucket),  
#### - `goalBucket` - the name of the bucket that reached the goal amount,  
#### - `otherBucket` - the amount contained in the other bucket.  
####   
#### Example:  
####   
#### ```json  
#### {  
####   "moves": 5,  
####   "goalBucket": "one",  
####   "otherBucket": 2  
#### }  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: two-bucket.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

This implementation:
1. Uses BFS to explore all possible states while tracking moves
2. Handles all valid operations (fill, empty, pour)
3. Enforces the rule about forbidden states
4. Returns the required result format
5. Maintains the original class structure and method names

The solution efficiently searches for the shortest path to the goal using a queue and visited set to avoid redundant checks. Each state transition generates all possible next moves while respecting the problem constraints.

    while (b !== 0) {
      [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds input validation to the constructor to check for impossible cases:
   - When goal is larger than both buckets
   - When goal isn't a multiple of the GCD of the bucket sizes (and not exactly matching either bucket size)
2. Adds a static GCD calculator using Euclidean algorithm
3. Throws appropriate errors that match what the tests expect

The validation happens before any state initialization, catching impossible cases early as required by the tests.
