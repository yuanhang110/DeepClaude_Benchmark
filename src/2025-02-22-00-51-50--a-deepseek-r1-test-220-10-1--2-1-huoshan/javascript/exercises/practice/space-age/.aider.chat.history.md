#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

I'll help modify the space-age.js file to calculate age on different planets based on their orbital periods. Here's what we need to do:

1. Create a lookup table for planetary orbital periods
2. Calculate Earth years from seconds first
3. Convert to target planet's years using the orbital period ratio
4. Round to 2 decimal places as per the example

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

space-age.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
//
// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Space Age' exercise. It's been provided as a

export const age = () => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};

const orbitalPeriods = {
  mercury: 0.2408467,
  venus: 0.61519726,
  earth: 1.0,
  mars: 1.8808158,
  jupiter: 11.862615,
  saturn: 29.447498,
  uranus: 84.016846,
  neptune: 164.79132
};

export const age = (planet, seconds) => {
  const earthAge = seconds / 31557600;
  const planetAge = earthAge / orbitalPeriods[planet.toLowerCase()];
  return Number(planetAge.toFixed(2));
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
- Takes the planet name (case-insensitive) and seconds as parameters
- First calculates the age in Earth years (seconds / 31557600)
- Then converts to the target planet's years using the orbital period ratio
- Returns the result rounded to 2 decimal places as a Number
- Uses the exact orbital period values from the problem description
