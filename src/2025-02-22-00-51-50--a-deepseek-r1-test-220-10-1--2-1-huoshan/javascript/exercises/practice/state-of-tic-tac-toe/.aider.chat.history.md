#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In this exercise, you're going to implement a program that determines the state of a [tic-tac-toe][] game.  
#### (_You may also know the game as "noughts and crosses" or "Xs and Os"._)  
####   
#### The game is played on a 3×3 grid.  
#### Players take turns to place `X`s and `O`s on the grid.  
#### The game ends when one player has won by placing three of marks in a row, column, or along a diagonal of the grid, or when the entire grid is filled up.  
####   
#### In this exercise, we will assume that `X` starts.  
####   
#### It's your job to determine which state a given game is in.  
####   
#### There are 3 potential game states:  
####   
#### - The game is **ongoing**.  
#### - The game ended in a **draw**.  
#### - The game ended in a **win**.  
####   
#### If the given board is invalid, throw an appropriate error.  
####   
#### If a board meets the following conditions, it is invalid:  
####   
#### - The given board cannot be reached when turns are taken in the correct order (remember that `X` starts).  
#### - The game was played after it already ended.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### ### Ongoing game  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  X |   |  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    | X | O  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####  O | X |  
####    |   |  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Draw  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  X | O | X  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####  X | X | O  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####  O | X | O  
####    |   |  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Win  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  X | X | X  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    | O | O  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Invalid  
####   
#### #### Wrong turn order  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  O | O | X  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
####    |   |  
#### ```  
####   
#### #### Continued playing after win  
####   
#### ```text  
####    |   |  
####  X | X | X  
#### ___|___|___  
####    |   |  
####  O | O | O

```

This implementation:
1. Validates turn order by checking X count is either equal to or one more than O count
2. Checks for wins using row/column/diagonal checks
3. Throws errors for invalid boards (both players winning, wrong turn order, continued play after win)
4. Returns the correct game state (win/draw/ongoing)
5. Handles edge cases like boards that are full but have a winning line

The code preserves the original function signature and uses only standard JavaScript features. The error messages match the examples given in the problem description.

#### See the testing errors above.

Let's fix the error messages to match the test expectations:

    throw new Error('Invalid board: incorrect turn order');
  }

    if (oCount > xCount) {
      throw new Error('Wrong turn order: O started');
    } else {
      throw new Error('Wrong turn order: X went twice');
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```

state-of-tic-tac-toe.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (xWon && xCount !== oCount + 1) {
    throw new Error('Invalid board: X win with invalid counts');
  }

  if (oWon && xCount !== oCount) {
    throw new Error('Invalid board: O win with invalid counts');
  }
=======
  if (xWon && xCount !== oCount + 1) {
    throw new Error('Impossible board: game should have ended after the game was won');
  }

  if (oWon && xCount !== oCount) {
    throw new Error('Impossible board: game should have ended after the game was won');
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Make turn order errors more specific with the exact messages expected by tests
2. Update "both players won" error to match test expectation
3. Update win validation errors to use the expected "Impossible board" message
