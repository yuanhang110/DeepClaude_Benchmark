#### # Instructions  
####   
#### In word search puzzles you get a square of letters and have to find specific words in them.  
####   
#### For example:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### jefblpepre  
#### camdcimgtc  
#### oivokprjsm  
#### pbwasqroua  
#### rixilelhrs  
#### wolcqlirpc  
#### screeaumgr  
#### alxhpburyi  
#### jalaycalmp  
#### clojurermt  
#### ```  
####   
#### There are several programming languages hidden in the above square.  
####   
#### Words can be hidden in all kinds of directions: left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical and diagonal.  
####   
#### Given a puzzle and a list of words return the location of the first and last letter of each word.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: word-search.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the WordSearch class to find words in all directions. Here are the changes needed:

1. Store the grid in the constructor
2. Implement search in all 8 directions
3. Return start/end coordinates for found words

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

word-search.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  constructor(grid) {
    this.grid = grid.map(row => row.split(''));
    this.rows = this.grid.length;
    this.cols = this.rows > 0 ? this.grid[0].length : 0;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

word-search.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  find() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  find(words) {
    const directions = [
      [0, 1],   // Right
      [1, 0],   // Down
      [0, -1],  // Left
      [-1, 0],  // Up
      [1, 1],   // Down-Right
      [1, -1],  // Down-Left
      [-1, 1],  // Up-Right
      [-1, -1]  // Up-Left
    ];
    
    const result = {};
    
    for (const word of words) {
      outer:
      for (let r = 0; r < this.rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < this.cols; c++) {
          if (this.grid[r][c] === word[0]) {
            for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
              let found = true;
              let endRow = r, endCol = c;
              
              for (let i = 1; i < word.length; i++) {
                const nr = r + dr * i;
                const nc = c + dc * i;
                
                if (nr < 0 || nr >= this.rows || nc < 0 || nc >= this.cols || 
                    this.grid[nr][nc] !== word[i]) {
                  found = false;
                  break;
                }
                endRow = nr;
                endCol = nc;
              }
              
              if (found) {
                result[word] = {
                  start: [r + 1, c + 1],
                  end: [endRow + 1, endCol + 1]
                };
                break outer;
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Stores the grid as a 2D array of characters in the constructor
2. Searches in all 8 directions using direction vectors
3. Uses 1-based indexing for coordinates as is common in word searches
4. Returns an object with words as keys and {start, end} coordinates as values
5. Handles edge cases by checking grid boundaries
6. Stops at the first match found for each word

The search checks each potential starting position, then explores all 8 possible directions from there, checking if the full word sequence matches in any direction.
