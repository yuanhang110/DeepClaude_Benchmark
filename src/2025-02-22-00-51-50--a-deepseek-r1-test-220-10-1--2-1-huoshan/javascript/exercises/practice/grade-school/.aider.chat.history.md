#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: grade-school.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

grade-school.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export class GradeSchool {
  roster() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  add() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  grade() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
}
=======
export class GradeSchool {
  constructor() {
    this._students = new Map();
  }

  roster() {
    const sorted = {};
    // Get sorted grades and sort each grade's names
    Array.from(this._students.keys())
      .sort((a, b) => a - b)
      .forEach(grade => {
        sorted[grade] = this.grade(grade);
      });
    return sorted;
  }

  add(name, grade) {
    // Check if student already exists in any grade
    if (this._studentExists(name)) {
      return;
    }
    
    if (!this._students.has(grade)) {
      this._students.set(grade, new Set());
    }
    this._students.get(grade).add(name);
  }

  grade(gradeNumber) {
    const grade = this._students.get(gradeNumber);
    return grade ? Array.from(grade).sort() : [];
  }

  _studentExists(name) {
    // Check all grades for existing student
    return Array.from(this._students.values())
      .some(students => students.has(name));
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes implement the grade school roster requirements by:

1. Adding a constructor with a Map to track students per grade
2. Implementing add() to:
   - Check if student exists in any grade using _studentExists helper
   - Add to specified grade's Set (which automatically handles duplicates)
3. Implementing grade() to return sorted array of names for a grade
4. Implementing roster() to return sorted grades with sorted student names
5. Using Sets to prevent duplicate students within grades

The implementation ensures:
- Students are unique across all grades
- Students are sorted alphabetically within grades
- Grades are sorted numerically in the roster
- Original method signatures are maintained
- Returns empty array for grades with no students

#### Fix the code in grade-school.js to resolve the errors.  

The issue is that when a student is added to a new grade, we need to first remove them from their existing grade. Let's fix the add() method:

grade-school.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  add(name, grade) {
    // Check if student already exists in any grade
    if (this._studentExists(name)) {
      return;
    }
    
    if (!this._students.has(grade)) {
      this._students.set(grade, new Set());
    }
    this._students.get(grade).add(name);
  }
=======
  add(name, grade) {
    // Check if student exists and remove from current grade
    const currentGrade = this._findGrade(name);
    if (currentGrade !== undefined) {
      this._students.get(currentGrade).delete(name);
    }
    
    // Add to new grade
    if (!this._students.has(grade)) {
      this._students.set(grade, new Set());
    }
    this._students.get(grade).add(name);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

grade-school.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  _studentExists(name) {
    // Check all grades for existing student
    return Array.from(this._students.values())
      .some(students => students.has(name));
  }
=======
  _findGrade(name) {
    // Find which grade the student is in
    for (const [grade, students] of this._students.entries()) {
      if (students.has(name)) {
        return grade;
      }
    }
    return undefined;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Replaced `_studentExists` with `_findGrade` that returns the actual grade a student is in
2. Modified add() to first remove a student from their existing grade before adding to a new one
3. Now properly handles student transfers between grades instead of just ignoring the add

This should fix the test failure by ensuring when a student is added to a new grade, they're removed from their previous grade.
