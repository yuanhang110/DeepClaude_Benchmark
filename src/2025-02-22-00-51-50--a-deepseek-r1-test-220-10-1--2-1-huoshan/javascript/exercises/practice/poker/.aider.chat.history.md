#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.  
####   
#### See [Wikipedia][poker-hands] for an overview of poker hands.  
####   
#### [poker-hands]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: poker.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the poker hand evaluation logic. We'll need to:

1. Add card ranking system
2. Implement hand strength evaluation
3. Compare multiple hands to find the best one(s)

Here are the changes:

poker.js
```javascript

  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};

const cardRank = {
  '2': 2, '3': 3, '4': 4, '5': 5, '6': 6, '7': 7, 
  '8': 8, '9': 9, '10': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14
};

function parseHand(hand) {
  return hand.split(' ').map(card => {
    const rank = card.slice(0, -1);
    return { 
      rank: cardRank[rank], 
      suit: card.slice(-1),
      original: card 
    };
  });
}

function evaluateHand(cards) {
  const ranks = cards.map(c => c.rank).sort((a, b) => b - a);
  const suits = cards.map(c => c.suit);
  const countByRank = ranks.reduce((acc, r) => ({...acc, [r]: (acc[r] || 0) + 1}), {});
  const groups = Object.entries(countByRank).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1] || b[0] - a[0]);
  
  const isFlush = new Set(suits).size === 1;
  const isStraight = new Set(ranks).size === 5 && Math.max(...ranks) - Math.min(...ranks) === 4;
  const isLowStraight = ranks.join(',') === '14,5,4,3,2';
  
  // Check straight flush (including royal flush)
  if (isStraight && isFlush) {
    return [8, Math.max(...ranks)];
  }
  if (isLowStraight && isFlush) {
    return [8, 5]; // Low straight (5-high)
  }
  
  // Check four of a kind
  if (groups[0][1] === 4) {
    return [7, groups[0][0], groups[1][0]];
  }
  
  // Check full house

    return [6, groups[0][0], groups[1][0]];

  if (isLowStraight) {

  }
  
  // Check three of a kind
  if (groups[0][1] === 3) {
    return [3, groups[0][0], ...groups.slice(1).map(g => g[0])];
  }
  
  // Check two pair
  if (groups[0][1] === 2 && groups[1][1] === 2) {
    return [2, groups[0][0], groups[1][0], groups[2][0]];

export const bestHands = (hands) => {

  const evaluated = hands.map(hand => {
    const cards = parseHand(hand);
    return {
      original: hand,
      score: evaluateHand(cards)

    curr.score.join() > max.join() ? curr.score : max, []);

    .map(e => e.original);
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Parses cards into rank/suit objects with numerical values
2. Evaluates hand strength using standard poker hand rankings
3. Properly handles ace-low straights (5-4-3-2-A)
4. Compares hands by their score arrays lexicographically
5. Returns all hands that tie for the highest score

The scoring system uses an array where:
[8, ...] = Straight flush
[7, ...] = Four of a kind
[6, ...] = Full house
[5, ...] = Flush
[4, ...] = Straight
[3, ...] = Three of a kind
[2, ...] = Two pair
[1, ...] = One pair
[0, ...] = High card

The remaining values in each array are the kicker values used for tie-breaking.

Let's fix the issues with the score comparisons and group rankings. Here are the necessary changes:

=======
    return [7, Number(groups[0][0]), Number(groups[1][0])];

=======
    return [6, Number(groups[0][0]), Number(groups[1][0])];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

poker.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return [3, groups[0][0], ...groups.slice(1).map(g => g[0])];
=======
    return [3, Number(groups[0][0]), ...groups.slice(1).map(g => Number(g[0]))];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

poker.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return [2, groups[0][0], groups[1][0], groups[2][0]];
=======
    return [2, Number(groups[0][0]), Number(groups[1][0]), Number(groups[2][0])];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

poker.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return [1, groups[0][0], ...groups.slice(1).map(g => g[0])];
=======
    return [1, Number(groups[0][0]), ...groups.slice(1).map(g => Number(g[0]))];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

poker.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const maxScore = evaluated.reduce((max, curr) => 
    curr.score.join() > max.join() ? curr.score : max, []);
  
  return evaluated
    .filter(e => e.score.join() === maxScore.join())
    .map(e => e.original);
=======
  // Compare scores element-wise with numeric comparison
  const maxScore = evaluated.reduce((maxEntry, currEntry) => {
    const curr = currEntry.score;
    const max = maxEntry.score;
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.max(curr.length, max.length); i++) {
      const currVal = curr[i] || 0;
      const maxVal = max[i] || 0;
      if (currVal > maxVal) return currEntry;
      if (currVal < maxVal) return maxEntry;
    }
    return maxEntry; // If all elements are equal
  }, evaluated[0]).score;
  
  return evaluated
    .filter(e => e.score.every((val, i) => val === (maxScore[i] || 0)))
    .map(e => e.original);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes address the key issues:

1. Convert group ranks to numbers in all hand evaluation returns
2. Fix score comparison to use numeric element-wise checks instead of string comparisons
3. Properly handle kicker card comparisons in all hand types
4. Fix group sorting by using numeric comparisons instead of string comparisons

The test failures should now be resolved with proper numeric comparisons for all poker hand rankings and kicker cards.
