#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A rational number is defined as the quotient of two integers `a` and `b`, called the numerator and denominator, respectively, where `b != 0`.  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### Note that mathematically, the denominator can't be zero.  
#### However in many implementations of rational numbers, you will find that the denominator is allowed to be zero with behaviour similar to positive or negative infinity in floating point numbers.  
#### In those cases, the denominator and numerator generally still can't both be zero at once.  
#### ~~~~  
####   
#### The absolute value `|r|` of the rational number `r = a/b` is equal to `|a|/|b|`.  
####   
#### The sum of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ + r₂ = a₁/b₁ + a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ + a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The difference of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ - r₂ = a₁/b₁ - a₂/b₂ = (a₁ * b₂ - a₂ * b₁) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### The product (multiplication) of two rational numbers `r₁ = a₁/b₁` and `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ * r₂ = (a₁ * a₂) / (b₁ * b₂)`.  
####   
#### Dividing a rational number `r₁ = a₁/b₁` by another `r₂ = a₂/b₂` is `r₁ / r₂ = (a₁ * b₂) / (a₂ * b₁)` if `a₂` is not zero.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a non-negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (a^n)/(b^n)`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a negative integer power `n` is `r^n = (b^m)/(a^m)`, where `m = |n|`.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a rational number `r = a/b` to a real (floating-point) number `x` is the quotient `(a^x)/(b^x)`, which is a real number.  
####   
#### Exponentiation of a real number `x` to a rational number `r = a/b` is `x^(a/b) = root(x^a, b)`, where `root(p, q)` is the `q`th root of `p`.  
####   
#### Implement the following operations:  
####   
#### - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rational numbers,  
#### - absolute value, exponentiation of a given rational number to an integer power, exponentiation of a given rational number to a real (floating-point) power, exponentiation of a real number to a rational number.  
####   
#### Your implementation of rational numbers should always be reduced to lowest terms.  
#### For example, `4/4` should reduce to `1/1`, `30/60` should reduce to `1/2`, `12/8` should reduce to `3/2`, etc.  
#### To reduce a rational number `r = a/b`, divide `a` and `b` by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.  
#### So, for example, `gcd(12, 8) = 4`, so `r = 12/8` can be reduced to `(12/4)/(8/4) = 3/2`.  
#### The reduced form of a rational number should be in "standard form" (the denominator should always be a positive integer).  
#### If a denominator with a negative integer is present, multiply both numerator and denominator by `-1` to ensure standard form is reached.  
#### For example, `3/-4` should be reduced to `-3/4`  
####   
#### Assume that the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of rational numbers.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: rational-numbers.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the Rational number class with step-by-step changes. We need to:

1. Add a constructor that stores numerator/denominator in reduced form
2. Implement arithmetic operations using rational number formulas
3. Add helper methods for gcd and reduction
4. Handle special cases like negative denominators and exponents

Here are the changes:

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  add() {
=======
  constructor(numerator, denominator) {
    const gcd = Rational.gcd(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));
    let num = numerator / gcd;
    let denom = denominator / gcd;
    if (denom < 0) {
      num *= -1;
      denom *= -1;
    }
    this.num = num;
    this.denom = denom;
  }

  static gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
      [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
  }

  add(other) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  sub() {
=======
    const numerator = this.num * other.denom + other.num * this.denom;
    const denominator = this.denom * other.denom;
    return new Rational(numerator, denominator);
  }

  sub(other) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  mul() {
=======
    const numerator = this.num * other.denom - other.num * this.denom;
    const denominator = this.denom * other.denom;
    return new Rational(numerator, denominator);
  }

  mul(other) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  div() {
=======
    const numerator = this.num * other.num;
    const denominator = this.denom * other.denom;
    return new Rational(numerator, denominator);
  }

  div(other) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  abs() {
=======
    const numerator = this.num * other.denom;
    const denominator = this.denom * other.num;
    return new Rational(numerator, denominator);
  }

  abs() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  exprational() {
=======
    return new Rational(Math.abs(this.num), Math.abs(this.denom));
  }

  exprational(n) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  expreal() {
=======
    if (n >= 0) {
      return new Rational(Math.pow(this.num, n), Math.pow(this.denom, n));
    } else {
      const m = -n;
      return new Rational(Math.pow(this.denom, m), Math.pow(this.num, m));
    }
  }

  expreal(x) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }

  reduce() {
=======
    return Math.pow(x, this.num / this.denom);
  }

  reduce() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
    return new Rational(this.num, this.denom);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Uses Euclid's algorithm for GCD in a static method
2. Automatically reduces fractions in the constructor
3. Maintains positive denominators
4. Follows mathematical formulas for rational operations
5. Handles both positive and negative exponents
6. Uses exact integer arithmetic for operations
7. Returns new Rational instances for chaining operations
8. Converts real exponents using roots and powers

The reduce() method returns a new Rational instance since the constructor already ensures reduced form.

The issue is floating point precision in the `expreal` method. Let's modify the calculation to use integer exponents for better precision by separating the root and power operations:

rational-numbers.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  expreal(x) {
    return Math.pow(x, this.num / this.denom);
  }
=======
  expreal(x) {
    // Calculate root first, then power to maintain precision with integer exponents
    return Math.pow(Math.pow(x, 1/this.denom), this.num);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change breaks the calculation into two steps:
1. First calculate the denominator root of x (e.g. cube root for denominator 3)
2. Then raise that result to the numerator power (e.g. square for numerator 2)

This gives better precision with integer exponents since we can get exact roots for perfect powers. The test case 8^(4/3) will now correctly calculate as (8^(1/3))^4 = 2^4 = 16 instead of 8^(1.3333333333333333) which has floating point precision issues.
