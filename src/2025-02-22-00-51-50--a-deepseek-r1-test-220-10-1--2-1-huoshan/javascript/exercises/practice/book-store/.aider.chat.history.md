#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
#### # Implementation  
####   
#### Define a function - `cost` - that calculates the cost for a given list of books based on defined discounts.  
####   
#### `cost` will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.  
#### For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.  
#### Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: book-store.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

export const cost = (books) => {
  throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
};
=======
export const cost = (books) => {
  if (books.length === 0) return 0;

  // Count book frequencies
  const counts = {};
  books.forEach(book => counts[book] = (counts[book] || 0) + 1);
  
  // Get sorted frequencies in descending order
  let freq = Object.values(counts).sort((a, b) => b - a);
  const groups = {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0};

  // Greedily create largest possible groups
  while (freq.length > 0 && freq[0] > 0) {
    // Determine current group size (number of different books)
    const size = freq.findIndex(c => c === 0) === -1 ? freq.length : freq.findIndex(c => c === 0);
    if (size === 0) break;
    
    groups[size]++;
    
    // Reduce counts for books in this group
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      freq[i]--;
    }
    
    // Re-sort and remove zeros
    freq = freq.filter(c => c > 0).sort((a, b) => b - a);
  }

  // Optimize groups: replace 5+3 groups with 4+4 for better discount
  const optimizedGroups = Math.min(groups[5], groups[3]);
  groups[5] -= optimizedGroups;
  groups[3] -= optimizedGroups;
  groups[4] += optimizedGroups * 2;

  // Calculate total cost with discounts
  const discounts = {1: 1.0, 2: 0.95, 3: 0.9, 4: 0.8, 5: 0.75};
  let total = 0;
  for (const [size, count] of Object.entries(groups)) {
    total += count * size * 800 * discounts[size];
  }

  return Math.round(total);
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:
1. Counts occurrences of each book
2. Sorts frequencies in descending order
3. Creates groups greedily by taking largest possible set each iteration
4. Optimizes groups by replacing 5+3 combinations with 4+4 for better discount
5. Calculates total cost using the discount rates
6. Returns total in cents as integer

The algorithm handles the example case correctly:
- Initial groups would be 5+3
- Optimization converts them to 4+4
- Final calculation uses 2 groups of 4 @ 20% discount each

The code follows JavaScript best practices and uses only standard language features.
