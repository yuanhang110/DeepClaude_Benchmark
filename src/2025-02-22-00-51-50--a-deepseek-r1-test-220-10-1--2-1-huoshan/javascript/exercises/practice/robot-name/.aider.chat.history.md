#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Manage robot factory settings.  
####   
#### When a robot comes off the factory floor, it has no name.  
####   
#### The first time you turn on a robot, a random name is generated in the format of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.  
####   
#### Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that its name gets wiped.  
#### The next time you ask, that robot will respond with a new random name.  
####   
#### The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.  
#### Using random names means a risk of collisions.  
#### Your solution must ensure that every existing robot has a unique name.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: robot-name.js  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help modify the robot-name.js file to implement the Robot class with unique name generation and reset functionality. Here are the changes:

robot-name.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Robot Name' exercise. It's been
// provided as a convenience to get your started writing code faster.

export class Robot {}

Robot.releaseNames = () => {};
=======
// This is only a SKELETON file for the 'Robot Name' exercise. It's been
// provided as a convenience to get your started writing code faster.

export class Robot {
  static usedNames = new Set();

  constructor() {
    this._name = null;
  }

  get name() {
    if (!this._name) {
      let newName;
      do {
        const letters = String.fromCharCode(
          65 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 26),
          65 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 26)
        );
        const digits = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000).toString().padStart(3, '0');
        newName = letters + digits;
      } while (Robot.usedNames.has(newName));
      
      Robot.usedNames.add(newName);
      this._name = newName;
    }
    return this._name;
  }

  reset() {
    if (this._name) {
      Robot.usedNames.delete(this._name);
      this._name = null;
    }
  }
}

Robot.releaseNames = () => {};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes include:

1. Added a static `usedNames` Set to track all generated names
2. Added name generation logic in the getter that:
   - Generates 2 random uppercase letters using character codes
   - Generates 3 random digits with zero padding
   - Ensures uniqueness through the `usedNames` Set
3. Added a `reset()` method to clear the current name
4. Maintained the existing `releaseNames` static method signature

The name is generated on first access following the factory reset pattern, and the reset method clears the current name while ensuring uniqueness when a new name is generated.

The implementation uses only standard JavaScript features and maintains all existing API signatures while adding the required functionality.

#### Fix the code in robot-name.js to resolve the errors.  

The issue is that when resetting a robot, we need to keep track of all previously used names to ensure absolute uniqueness. The current implementation allows reuse of old names after they've been reset. Here's the fix:

robot-name.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  reset() {
    if (this._name) {
      Robot.usedNames.delete(this._name);
      this._name = null;
    }
  }
=======
  reset() {
    if (this._name) {
      this._name = null;
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

By removing the `delete()` call, we maintain a complete registry of ALL names ever generated, ensuring that reset robots get truly unique new names rather than potentially reusing old ones. This matches the test's expectation that after 10,000 robots + 1 reset, there should be 10,001 unique names in total.
