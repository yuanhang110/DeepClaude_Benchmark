#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Compute the result for a game of Hex / Polygon.  
####   
#### The abstract boardgame known as [Hex][hex] / Polygon / CON-TAC-TIX is quite simple in rules, though complex in practice.  
#### Two players place stones on a parallelogram with hexagonal fields.  
#### The player to connect his/her stones to the opposite side first wins.  
#### The four sides of the parallelogram are divided between the two players (i.e. one player gets assigned a side and the side directly opposite it and the other player gets assigned the two other sides).  
####   
#### Your goal is to build a program that given a simple representation of a board computes the winner (or lack thereof).  
#### Note that all games need not be "fair".  
#### (For example, players may have mismatched piece counts or the game's board might have a different width and height.)  
####   
#### The boards look like this:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### . O . X .  
####  . X X O .  
####   O O O X .  
####    . X O X O  
####     X O O O X  
#### ```  
####   
#### "Player `O`" plays from top to bottom, "Player `X`" plays from left to right.  
#### In the above example `O` has made a connection from left to right but nobody has won since `O` didn't connect top and bottom.

#### ####  
####   
#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in connect.js to resolve the errors.  

The test failures show we need to return an empty string '' instead of null when there's no winner. Let's fix the return values in the winner() method:

connect.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  winner() {
    if (this.rows === 0 || this.cols === 0) return null;
=======
  winner() {
    if (this.rows === 0 || this.cols === 0) return '';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

connect.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return null;
=======
    return '';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Also, we need to handle the case where a player's pieces connect edges they shouldn't. Let's fix the BFS goal checks:

connect.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      if (isGoal(r, c)) return true;
=======
      // Check if we reached the correct edge for the player
      if (player === 'O' && r === this.rows - 1) return true;
      if (player === 'X' && c === this.cols - 1) return true;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:
1. Return empty string instead of null for no winner (matching test expectations)
2. Fix the edge connection checks to properly validate which edges count as wins for each player
3. Handle the edge cases shown in the failing tests where diagonal or adjacent pieces were incorrectly considered winning connections
