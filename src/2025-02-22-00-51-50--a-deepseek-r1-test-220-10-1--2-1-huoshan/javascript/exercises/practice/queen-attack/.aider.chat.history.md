#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.  
####   
#### In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.  
####   
#### A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.  
####   
#### So if you are told the white queen is at `c5` (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at `f2` (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:  
####   
#### ![A chess board with two queens. Arrows emanating from the queen at c5 indicate possible directions of capture along file, rank and diagonal.](https://assets.exercism.org/images/exercises/queen-attack/queen-capture.svg)  
####   
#### You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.  
#### In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.  
####   
#### ## Credit

#### # Instructions append  
####   
#### A queen must be placed on a valid position on the board.  
#### Two queens cannot share the same position.  
####   
#### If a position has not been given, the queens are at their [default starting positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Initial_setup). That's the bottom row (1) for the white queen and the top row (8) for the black queen. Both queens start in the fourth column (d).

#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help modify the QueenAttack class to implement the chess queen attack validation. We need to:

1. Add position validation in constructor
2. Implement default positions
3. Add board string representation
4. Implement attack detection logic

Here are the changes:

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor({
    black: [blackRow, blackColumn] = [],
    white: [whiteRow, whiteColumn] = [],
  } = {}) {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  constructor({
    black: [blackRow, blackColumn] = [0, 3],    // Default black at (0,3) - a8
    white: [whiteRow, whiteColumn] = [7, 3],     // Default white at (7,3) - d1
  } = {}) {
    
    // Validate positions are on the board
    const isValid = (r, c) => r >= 0 && r < 8 && c >= 0 && c < 8;
    if (!isValid(blackRow, blackColumn) || !isValid(whiteRow, whiteColumn)) {
      throw new Error('Queen position out of bounds');
    }
    
    // Check for overlapping positions
    if (blackRow === whiteRow && blackColumn === whiteColumn) {
      throw new Error('Queens cannot occupy the same position');
    }
    
    // Store positions
    this.black = [blackRow, blackColumn];
    this.white = [whiteRow, whiteColumn];
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  toString() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  toString() {
    const board = Array.from({length: 8}, () => Array(8).fill('_'));
    
    // Place queens on board
    const [bRow, bCol] = this.black;
    const [wRow, wCol] = this.white;
    board[bRow][bCol] = 'B';
    board[wRow][wCol] = 'W';
    
    // Convert to string representation
    return board.map(row => row.join(' ')).join('\n') + '\n';
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  get canAttack() {
    throw new Error('Remove this statement and implement this function');
  }
=======
  get canAttack() {
    const [bRow, bCol] = this.black;
    const [wRow, wCol] = this.white;
    
    // Same row or column
    if (bRow === wRow || bCol === wCol) return true;
    
    // Diagonal check (absolute difference of rows equals absolute difference of columns)
    return Math.abs(bRow - wRow) === Math.abs(bCol - wCol);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. Constructor handles validation and default positions (black at a8/d4, white at d1)
2. toString() builds an 8x8 grid with proper queen placement
3. canAttack checks row, column, and diagonal attack patterns
4. Uses zero-indexed coordinates as specified in the problem
5. Throws clear errors for invalid positions

The code follows the requirements:
- Queens cannot share the same position
- Validates positions are within 0-7 range
- Default positions are set correctly
- Attack detection covers all possible queen moves
- Returns proper string representation of the board

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in queen-attack.js to resolve the errors.  

Let's fix the test failures by:
1. Updating error messages to match test expectations
2. Correcting the board formatting (remove trailing newline)
3. Fixing queen default positions

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (!isValid(blackRow, blackColumn) || !isValid(whiteRow, whiteColumn)) {
      throw new Error('Queen position out of bounds');
=======
    if (!isValid(blackRow, blackColumn) || !isValid(whiteRow, whiteColumn)) {
      throw new Error('Queen must be placed on the board');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (blackRow === whiteRow && blackColumn === whiteColumn) {
      throw new Error('Queens cannot occupy the same position');
=======
    if (blackRow === whiteRow && blackColumn === whiteColumn) {
      throw new Error('Queens cannot share the same space');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

queen-attack.js
```javascript
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return board.map(row => row.join(' ')).join('\n') + '\n';
=======
    return board.map(row => row.join(' ')).join('\n');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Align error messages with test expectations
2. Remove trailing newline from board output to match test requirements
3. Keep existing coordinate logic that was correct (default positions and attack detection were working as shown by passing tests)
