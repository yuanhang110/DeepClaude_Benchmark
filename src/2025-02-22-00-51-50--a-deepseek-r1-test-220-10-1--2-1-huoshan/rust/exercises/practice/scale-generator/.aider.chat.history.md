#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given a tonic, or starting note, and a set of intervals, generate  
#### the musical scale starting with the tonic and following the  
#### specified interval pattern.  
####   
#### Scales in Western music are based on the chromatic (12-note) scale. This  
#### scale can be expressed as the following group of pitches:  
####   
#### A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#  
####   
#### A given sharp note (indicated by a #) can also be expressed as the flat  
#### of the note above it (indicated by a b) so the chromatic scale can also be  
#### written like this:  
####   
#### A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab  
####   
#### The major and minor scale and modes are subsets of this twelve-pitch  
#### collection. They have seven pitches, and are called diatonic scales.  
#### The collection of notes in these scales is written with either sharps or  
#### flats, depending on the tonic. Here is a list of which are which:  
####   
#### No Sharps or Flats:  
#### C major  
#### a minor  
####   
#### Use Sharps:  
#### G, D, A, E, B, F# major  
#### e, b, f#, c#, g#, d# minor  
####   
#### Use Flats:  
#### F, Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb major  
#### d, g, c, f, bb, eb minor  
####   
#### The diatonic scales, and all other scales that derive from the  
#### chromatic scale, are built upon intervals. An interval is the space  
#### between two pitches.  
####   
#### The simplest interval is between two adjacent notes, and is called a  
#### "half step", or "minor second" (sometimes written as a lower-case "m").  
#### The interval between two notes that have an interceding note is called  
#### a "whole step" or "major second" (written as an upper-case "M"). The  
#### diatonic scales are built using only these two intervals between  
#### adjacent notes.  
####   
#### Non-diatonic scales can contain other intervals.  An "augmented second"  
#### interval, written "A", has two interceding notes (e.g., from A to C or Db to E)  
#### or a "whole step" plus a "half step". There are also smaller and larger  
#### intervals, but they will not figure into this exercise.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the scale generation logic. We need to:

1. Add proper error handling
2. Implement the scale generation with correct note sequences
3. Handle both sharps and flats based on tonic

Here are the necessary changes:

lib.rs

const SHARP_NOTES: [&str; 12] = ["A", "A#", "B", "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#"];
const FLAT_NOTES: [&str; 12] = ["A", "Bb", "B", "C", "Db", "D", "Eb", "E", "F", "Gb", "G", "Ab"];

fn determine_accidentals(tonic: &str) -> Result<&[&str; 12], Error> {
    match tonic {
        "C" | "a" => Ok(&SHARP_NOTES),

        _ => Err(Error::InvalidTonic),
    }
}

fn note_index(tonic: &str, notes: &[&str; 12]) -> Result<usize, Error> {

    }

        let tonic_index = note_index(tonic, accidentals)?;
        
        if intervals.is_empty() || !intervals.chars().all(|c| matches!(c, 'M' | 'm' | 'A')) {
            return Err(Error::InvalidInterval);
        }

        let mut current = tonic_index;
        let mut notes = vec![accidentals[current].to_string()];
        
        for c in intervals.chars() {
            let step = match c {
                'M' => 2,
                'm' => 1,
                'A' => 3,
                _ => return Err(Error::InvalidInterval),
            };
            current = (current + step) % 12;
            notes.push(accidentals[current].to_string());
        }

        Ok(Scale { notes })
    }

    pub fn chromatic(tonic: &str) -> Result<Scale, Error> {
        Self::new(tonic, "mmmmmmmmmmm")
    }

    pub fn enumerate(&self) -> Vec<String> {
        self.notes.clone()
    }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation:

1. Adds proper error variants for invalid input
2. Creates two chromatic scale representations (sharps and flats)
3. Determines which accidentals to use based on the tonic
4. Implements scale generation using interval steps
5. Handles both major/minor scales and arbitrary interval patterns
6. Follows the specified rules for sharp/flat usage based on tonic

The code maintains the existing API but adds proper error handling and implementation details. The determine_accidentals function encodes the rules about which tonics use sharps vs flats.

The issue is that the chromatic scale should include the octave note, making 13 notes total (12 intervals). Let's fix the chromatic scale generation by adding one more 'm' interval to complete the octave.

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn chromatic(tonic: &str) -> Result<Scale, Error> {
        Self::new(tonic, "mmmmmmmmmmm")
=======
    pub fn chromatic(tonic: &str) -> Result<Scale, Error> {
        Self::new(tonic, "mmmmmmmmmmmm")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds one more half-step interval ('m') to the chromatic scale construction, ensuring we get the full 13-note chromatic scale including the octave. The interval pattern now has 12 'm's which will produce 13 notes (12 intervals × 1 half-step each = 12 half-steps = 1 octave).
