#### # Instructions  
####   
#### To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.  
####   
#### One copy of any of the five books costs $8.  
####   
#### If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.  
####   
#### If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.  
####   
#### If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.  
####   
#### Note that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.  
####   
#### Your mission is to write code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.  
####   
#### For example, how much does this basket of books cost?  
####   
#### - 2 copies of the first book  
#### - 2 copies of the second book  
#### - 2 copies of the third book  
#### - 1 copy of the fourth book  
#### - 1 copy of the fifth book  
####   
#### One way of grouping these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 5 (1st, 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th)  
#### - 1 group of 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 5 books at a 25% discount  
#### - 3 books at a 10% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 5 × (100% - 25%) × $8 = 5 × $6.00 = $30.00, plus  
#### - 3 × (100% - 10%) × $8 = 3 × $7.20 = $21.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.60.  
####   
#### However, a different way to group these 8 books is:  
####   
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)  
#### - 1 group of 4 books (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th)  
####   
#### This would give a total of:  
####   
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
#### - 4 books at a 20% discount  
####   
#### Resulting in:  
####   
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60, plus  
#### - 4 × (100% - 20%) × $8 = 4 × $6.40 = $25.60  
####   
#### Which equals $51.20.  
####   
#### And $51.20 is the price with the biggest discount.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.

```

This implementation:
1. Counts occurrences of each book (1-5)
2. Uses memoized recursion to try all possible groupings
3. Always keeps the counts sorted to maximize discounts
4. Calculates group costs using precomputed discount rates
5. Uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal grouping

The algorithm prioritizes forming larger groups but will automatically find optimal combinations like the example where two groups of four are better than one group of five and three.
