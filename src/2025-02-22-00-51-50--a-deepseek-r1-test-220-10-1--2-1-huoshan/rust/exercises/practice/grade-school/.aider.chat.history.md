#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.  
####   
#### In the end, you should be able to:  
####   
#### - Add a student's name to the roster for a grade  
####   - "Add Jim to grade 2."  
####   - "OK."  
#### - Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade  
####   - "Which students are in grade 2?"  
####   - "We've only got Jim just now."  
#### - Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  
####   Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.  
####   - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"  
####   - "Let me think.  
####     We have Anna, Barb, and Charlie in grade 1, Alex, Peter, and Zoe in grade 2 and Jim in grade 5.  
####     So the answer is: Anna, Barb, Charlie, Alex, Peter, Zoe and Jim"  
####   
#### Note that all our students only have one name (It's a small town, what do you want?) and each student cannot be added more than once to a grade or the roster.  
#### In fact, when a test attempts to add the same student more than once, your implementation should indicate that this is incorrect.  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: lib.rs  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help modify the code to implement the school roster functionality using Rust's standard collections. Here are the changes:

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
pub struct School {}
=======
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};

pub struct School {
    roster: HashMap<u32, HashSet<String>>,
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn new() -> School {
        todo!()
    }
=======
    pub fn new() -> School {
        School {
            roster: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn add(&mut self, grade: u32, student: &str) {
        todo!("Add {student} to the roster for {grade}")
    }
=======
    pub fn add(&mut self, grade: u32, student: &str) {
        self.roster
            .entry(grade)
            .or_insert_with(HashSet::new)
            .insert(student.to_string());
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn grades(&self) -> Vec<u32> {
        todo!()
    }
=======
    pub fn grades(&self) -> Vec<u32> {
        let mut grades: Vec<u32> = self.roster.keys().cloned().collect();
        grades.sort_unstable();
        grades
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn grade(&self, grade: u32) -> Vec<String> {
        todo!("Return the list of students in {grade}")
    }
=======
    pub fn grade(&self, grade: u32) -> Vec<String> {
        self.roster
            .get(&grade)
            .map(|students| {
                let mut students: Vec<String> = students.iter().cloned().collect();
                students.sort();
                students
            })
            .unwrap_or_default()
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Add a HashMap to store grades with HashSet of student names (ensures uniqueness)
2. Implement proper initialization in new()
3. Add students to the appropriate grade's HashSet
4. Return sorted list of grades using sort_unstable() for efficiency
5. Return alphabetically sorted student names using sort() on Vec<String>

The implementation maintains the existing API contract while:
- Ensuring students are unique per grade via HashSet
- Sorting grades numerically and students alphabetically
- Using efficient standard library operations
- Handling missing grades gracefully with unwrap_or_default()

#### See the testing errors above.

#### Fix the code in lib.rs to resolve the errors.  

The failing test shows that when a student is moved between grades, they should be removed from their previous grade. Let's fix this by ensuring when we add a student to a grade, we first remove them from all other grades.

lib.rs
```rust
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    pub fn add(&mut self, grade: u32, student: &str) {
        self.roster
            .entry(grade)
            .or_insert_with(HashSet::new)
            .insert(student.to_string());
    }
=======
    pub fn add(&mut self, grade: u32, student: &str) {
        // Remove student from all grades first
        for students in self.roster.values_mut() {
            students.remove(student);
        }
        // Add to specified grade
        self.roster
            .entry(grade)
            .or_insert_with(HashSet::new)
            .insert(student.to_string());
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that:
1. We iterate through all grades and remove the student if they exist in any
2. Then add them to the specified grade
3. Maintains the uniqueness constraint across all grades

The test failure was happening because the original implementation allowed a student to exist in multiple grades simultaneously, while the test expected them to only be in their most recent grade.
