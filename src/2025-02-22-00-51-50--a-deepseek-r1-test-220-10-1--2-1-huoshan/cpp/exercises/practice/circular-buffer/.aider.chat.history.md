#### # Instructions  
####   
#### A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.  
####   
#### A circular buffer first starts empty and of some predefined length.  
#### For example, this is a 7-element buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Assume that a 1 is written into the middle of the buffer (exact starting location does not matter in a circular buffer):  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][ ][ ][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Then assume that two more elements are added — 2 & 3 — which get appended after the 1:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][1][2][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If two elements are then removed from the buffer, the oldest values inside the buffer are removed.  
#### The two elements removed, in this case, are 1 & 2, leaving the buffer with just a 3:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][3][ ]  
#### ```  
####   
#### If the buffer has 7 elements then it is completely full:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][3][4]  
#### ```  
####   
#### When the buffer is full an error will be raised, alerting the client that further writes are blocked until a slot becomes free.  
####   
#### When the buffer is full, the client can opt to overwrite the oldest data with a forced write.  
#### In this case, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [5][6][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### 3 & 4 have been replaced by A & B making 5 now the oldest data in the buffer.  
#### Finally, if two elements are removed then what would be returned is 5 & 6 yielding the buffer:  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [ ][ ][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### Because there is space available, if the client again uses overwrite to store C & D then the space where 5 & 6 were stored previously will be used not the location of 7 & 8.  
#### 7 is still the oldest element and the buffer is once again full.  
####   
#### ```text  
#### [C][D][7][8][9][A][B]  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: circular_buffer.h circular_buffer.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the circular buffer. We need to:

1. Add a circular_buffer class in the header with core functionality
2. Implement the methods in the C++ source file
3. Handle edge cases like overflow and overwrites

Here are the changes:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer
=======
#include <stdexcept>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>
class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(size_t capacity);
    ~circular_buffer();

    T read();
    void write(const T& data);
    void overwrite(const T& data);
    void clear();
    size_t size() const { return count; }
    bool empty() const { return count == 0; }
    bool full() const { return count == capacity; }

private:
    T* buffer;
    size_t head = 0;
    size_t tail = 0;
    size_t count = 0;
    const size_t capacity;
};

template <typename T>
circular_buffer<T>::circular_buffer(size_t capacity) 
    : capacity(capacity), buffer(new T[capacity]) {}

template <typename T>
circular_buffer<T>::~circular_buffer() {
    delete[] buffer;
}

}  // namespace circular_buffer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

}  // namespace circular_buffer
=======
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
    if (count == 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Cannot read from empty buffer");
    }
    
    T value = buffer[head];
    head = (head + 1) % capacity;
    --count;
    return value;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::write(const T& data) {
    if (count == capacity) {
        throw std::domain_error("Cannot write to full buffer");
    }
    
    buffer[tail] = data;
    tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
    ++count;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::overwrite(const T& data) {
    if (count < capacity) {
        write(data);
    } else {
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
        head = (head + 1) % capacity;
    }
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::clear() {
    head = 0;
    tail = 0;
    count = 0;
}

// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer<char>;

}  // namespace circular_buffer
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation includes:
1. Templated circular buffer class with configurable capacity
2. Core operations: read, write, overwrite
3. Error handling for edge cases
4. Efficient modulo arithmetic for circular behavior
5. Explicit template instantiations for common types
6. Methods to check buffer state (empty/full/size)

The buffer uses:
- Head index to track oldest element
- Tail index to track next write position
- Count to track current number of elements
- Modulo arithmetic to wrap indices around
- Exception throwing for invalid operations
- Overwrite that replaces oldest element when full

Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions about specific implementation details!

I notice the explicit template instantiations need to be properly qualified with the namespace. Here's the fix:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer<char>;
=======
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<char>;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the proper namespace qualification to the template instantiations. The `circular_buffer::circular_buffer` syntax explicitly specifies:
1. The namespace `circular_buffer`
2. The template class `circular_buffer` within that namespace

This avoids any potential ambiguity between the namespace and class names being identical.

The explicit template instantiations still need adjustment. When explicitly instantiating template classes in C++, we need to use the correct template parameter syntax. Here's the fix:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<char>;
=======
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer<char>;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix removes the redundant namespace qualifier since we're already inside the `circular_buffer` namespace in the implementation file. The template class name should be specified without the namespace prefix here because:
1. The code is already within the `namespace circular_buffer` block
2. The template class is declared in this same namespace
3. This matches the standard C++ template instantiation syntax

After careful review, there are no errors in the explicit template instantiations. The current implementation is correct because:

1. We're already inside the `circular_buffer` namespace context in the .cpp file
2. The template class name is properly scoped within its namespace
3. The explicit instantiations match the class template declaration

The code follows standard C++ practice for template explicit instantiation. The implementation is correct as shown in the provided files. No changes are needed to these lines.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in circular_buffer.h circular_buffer.cpp to resolve the errors.  

Let's fix the header file issues first:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
template <typename T>
class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(size_t capacity);
    ~circular_buffer();

    T read();
    void write(const T& data);
    void overwrite(const T& data);
    void clear();
    size_t size() const { return count; }
    bool empty() const { return count == 0; }
    bool full() const { return count == capacity; }

private:
    T* buffer;
    size_t head = 0;
    size_t tail = 0;
    size_t count = 0;
    const size_t capacity;
};

template <typename T>
circular_buffer<T>::circular_buffer(size_t capacity) 
    : capacity(capacity), buffer(new T[capacity]) {}

template <typename T>
circular_buffer<T>::~circular_buffer() {
    delete[] buffer;
}
=======
template <typename T>
class circular_buffer {
public:
    explicit circular_buffer(size_t capacity) 
        : capacity(capacity), buffer(new T[capacity]) {}
        
    ~circular_buffer() {
        delete[] buffer;
    }

    T read();
    void write(const T& data);
    void overwrite(const T& data);
    void clear();
    size_t size() const { return count; }
    bool empty() const { return count == 0; }
    bool full() const { return count == capacity; }

private:
    T* buffer;
    size_t head = 0;
    size_t tail = 0;
    size_t count = 0;
    const size_t capacity;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's fix the implementation file:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
=======
#include "circular_buffer.h"

namespace circular_buffer {

template <typename T>
T circular_buffer<T>::read() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:
1. Move constructor/destructor definitions inside the class declaration
2. Keep all template definitions in the header file
3. Fix namespace scoping issues
4. Maintain explicit template instantiations for common types

The error occurred because template class implementations must be fully defined in headers, and there was a namespace mismatch between the declaration and implementation. By moving the template function definitions into the header and keeping only explicit instantiations in the cpp file, we resolve the compiler errors.

The main issue is that template implementations need to stay in the header file. Let's fix this:

circular_buffer.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    T read();
    void write(const T& data);
    void overwrite(const T& data);
    void clear();

    bool full() const { return count == capacity; }
=======
    T read() {
        if (count == 0) {
            throw std::domain_error("Cannot read from empty buffer");
        }
        
        T value = buffer[head];
        head = (head + 1) % capacity;
        --count;
        return value;
    }

    void write(const T& data) {
        if (count == capacity) {
            throw std::domain_error("Cannot write to full buffer");
        }
        
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
        ++count;
    }

    void overwrite(const T& data) {
        if (count < capacity) {
            write(data);
        } else {
            buffer[tail] = data;
            tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;
            head = (head + 1) % capacity;
        }
    }

    void clear() {
        head = 0;
        tail = 0;
        count = 0;
    }

    size_t size() const { return count; }
    bool empty() const { return count == 0; }
    bool full() const { return count == capacity; }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH

    if (count == 0) {
        throw std::domain_error("Cannot read from empty buffer");
    }
    
    T value = buffer[head];
    head = (head + 1) % capacity;
    --count;
    return value;
}

template <typename T>
void circular_buffer<T>::write(const T& data) {
    if (count == capacity) {
        throw std::domain_error("Cannot write to full buffer");
    }
    
    buffer[tail] = data;
    tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;

void circular_buffer<T>::overwrite(const T& data) {
    if (count < capacity) {
        write(data);
    } else {
        buffer[tail] = data;
        tail = (tail + 1) % capacity;

```

This moves all template method implementations into the header file where they belong, and removes them from the cpp file. The explicit template instantiations in the cpp file remain to force compilation of those specific types.

The error occurred because template method implementations need to be visible to any compilation unit that uses them (like the test file), which requires them to be in the header. The explicit instantiations in the cpp file are still needed to avoid linker errors for those specific types.

The error is due to missing namespace qualification in the template instantiations. Here's the fix:

circular_buffer.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer<char>;
=======
// Explicit template instantiation for common types
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer::circular_buffer<char>;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds the proper namespace qualification to the template instantiations. The `circular_buffer::circular_buffer` syntax specifies:
1. The namespace `circular_buffer`
2. The template class `circular_buffer` within that namespace

This matches the class declaration in the header file and resolves the linker errors seen in the test failures.

template class circular_buffer<int>;
template class circular_buffer<double>;
template class circular_buffer<char>;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The error occurs because we're already inside the `circular_buffer` namespace in the implementation file. The `circular_buffer::` prefix is redundant and causes a compiler error. The fix removes the redundant namespace qualification from the template instantiations.
