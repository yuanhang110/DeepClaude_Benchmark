#### # Instructions  
####   
#### The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape.  
#### Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.  
####   
#### ## Requirements  
####   
#### - The first row contains one 'A'.  
#### - The last row contains one 'A'.  
#### - All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.  
#### - All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).  
#### - The diamond is horizontally symmetric.  
#### - The diamond is vertically symmetric.  
#### - The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).  
#### - The letters form a diamond shape.  
#### - The top half has the letters in ascending order.  
#### - The bottom half has the letters in descending order.  
#### - The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.  
####   
#### ## Examples  
####   
#### In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'A':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### A  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'C':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ··A··  
#### ·B·B·  
#### C···C  
#### ·B·B·  
#### ··A··  
#### ```  
####   
#### Diamond for letter 'E':  
####   
#### ```text  
#### ····A····  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### E·······E  
#### ·D·····D·  
#### ··C···C··  
#### ···B·B···  
#### ····A····  
#### ```  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: diamond.cpp diamond.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the diamond kata solution. We need to:

1. Add a generate function in the diamond namespace
2. Implement the diamond pattern logic using standard C++

Here are the changes:

diamond.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#pragma once

#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace diamond {

// Generate a diamond pattern for the given letter
std::vector<std::string> generate(char c);

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

diamond.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "diamond.h"

namespace diamond {

}  // namespace diamond
=======
#include "diamond.h"

namespace diamond {

std::vector<std::string> generate(char c) {
    if (c == 'A') return {"A"};  // Edge case
    
    const int size = (c - 'A') * 2 + 1;
    const int mid = size / 2;
    std::vector<std::string> diamond;
    
    // Build top half
    for (int row = 0; row <= mid; ++row) {
        std::string line(size, ' ');
        const char curr_char = 'A' + row;
        
        // Set left and right characters
        line[mid - row] = curr_char;
        line[mid + row] = curr_char;
        
        diamond.push_back(line);
    }
    
    // Mirror top half to create bottom (excluding middle row)
    for (int row = mid - 1; row >= 0; --row) {
        diamond.push_back(diamond[row]);
    }
    
    return diamond;
}

}  // namespace diamond
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation works by:
1. Calculating the diamond size based on input character
2. Building the top half with proper character spacing
3. Mirroring the top half to create the bottom
4. Using a vector of strings to represent each row

The algorithm ensures:
- Square shape with correct symmetry
- Proper spacing between characters
- Ascending/descending order of letters
- Efficient O(n) space and time complexity

For example, when called with 'C', it generates a 5x5 grid matching the required pattern.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in diamond.cpp diamond.h to resolve the errors.  

The error is due to a mismatch between the function name in the tests (`rows`) and our implementation (`generate`). Let's fix the naming:

diamond.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// Generate a diamond pattern for the given letter
std::vector<std::string> generate(char c);
=======
// Get rows of a diamond pattern for the given letter
std::vector<std::string> rows(char c);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

diamond.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
std::vector<std::string> generate(char c) {
    if (c == 'A') return {"A"};  // Edge case
=======
std::vector<std::string> rows(char c) {
    if (c == 'A') return {"A"};  // Edge case
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This aligns our implementation with the test expectations by renaming `generate()` to `rows()` while keeping all the same functionality. The parameter types and return values match what the tests are expecting.
