#### # Introduction  
####   
#### The year is 2525 and you've just embarked on a journey to visit all planets in the Solar System (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune).  
#### The first stop is Mercury, where customs require you to fill out a form (bureaucracy is apparently _not_ Earth-specific).  
#### As you hand over the form to the customs officer, they scrutinize it and frown.  
#### "Do you _really_ expect me to believe you're just 50 years old?  
#### You must be closer to 200 years old!"  
####   
#### Amused, you wait for the customs officer to start laughing, but they appear to be dead serious.  
#### You realize that you've entered your age in _Earth years_, but the officer expected it in _Mercury years_!  
#### As Mercury's orbital period around the sun is significantly shorter than Earth, you're actually a lot older in Mercury years.  
#### After some quick calculations, you're able to provide your age in Mercury Years.  
#### The customs officer smiles, satisfied, and waves you through.  
#### You make a mental note to pre-calculate your planet-specific age _before_ future customs checks, to avoid such mix-ups.

#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on a planet in our Solar System.  
####   
#### One Earth year equals 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds.  
#### If you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, their age would be 31.69 Earth-years.  
####   
#### For the other planets, you have to account for their orbital period in Earth Years:  
####   
#### | Planet  | Orbital period in Earth Years |  
#### | ------- | ----------------------------- |  
#### | Mercury | 0.2408467                     |  
#### | Venus   | 0.61519726                    |  
#### | Earth   | 1.0                           |  
#### | Mars    | 1.8808158                     |  
#### | Jupiter | 11.862615                     |  
#### | Saturn  | 29.447498                     |  
#### | Uranus  | 84.016846                     |  
#### | Neptune | 164.79132                     |  
####   
#### ~~~~exercism/note  
#### The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year).  
#### The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days.  
#### While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise.  
#### See [Year on Wikipedia][year] for more ways to measure a year.

#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: space_age.cpp space_age.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the space age calculation. We need to:

1. Create a class in the space_age namespace that stores seconds
2. Add methods for each planet's age calculation
3. Use the exact orbital period values from the table

Here are the changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
namespace space_age {

class space_age {
public:
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    
    double on_mercury() const;
    double on_venus() const;
    double on_earth() const;
    double on_mars() const;
    double on_jupiter() const;
    double on_saturn() const;
    double on_uranus() const;
    double on_neptune() const;

private:
    long long seconds_;
    constexpr static double earth_seconds_per_year_ = 31557600.0;
};

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
namespace space_age {

}  // namespace space_age
=======
namespace space_age {

space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : seconds_(seconds) {}

double space_age::on_mercury() const { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 0.2408467; }
double space_age::on_venus() const   { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 0.61519726; }
double space_age::on_earth() const  { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_; }
double space_age::on_mars() const    { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 1.8808158; }
double space_age::on_jupiter() const { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 11.862615; }
double space_age::on_saturn() const  { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 29.447498; }
double space_age::on_uranus() const  { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 84.016846; }
double space_age::on_neptune() const { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 164.79132; }

}  // namespace space_age
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
- Stores the input seconds in the constructor
- Uses constant earth_seconds_per_year_ (31557600) for Earth year calculation
- Each planet method divides the Earth years by its orbital period
- Uses exact orbital period values from the problem description
- All calculations done with double precision floating point
- Methods are const as they don't modify object state

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in space_age.cpp space_age.h to resolve the errors.  

The error shows the tests are trying to access a `seconds()` method that doesn't exist. We need to add a public accessor for the stored seconds. Here are the changes:

space_age.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    
    double on_mercury() const;
=======
    explicit space_age(long long seconds);
    
    long long seconds() const;
    double on_mercury() const;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

space_age.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : seconds_(seconds) {}

double space_age::on_mercury() const { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 0.2408467; }
=======
space_age::space_age(long long seconds) : seconds_(seconds) {}

long long space_age::seconds() const { return seconds_; }

double space_age::on_mercury() const { return seconds_ / earth_seconds_per_year_ / 0.2408467; }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds a public `seconds()` method that returns the stored seconds value, which will let the tests verify the stored time value. The method is const-qualified to match the test's usage.
