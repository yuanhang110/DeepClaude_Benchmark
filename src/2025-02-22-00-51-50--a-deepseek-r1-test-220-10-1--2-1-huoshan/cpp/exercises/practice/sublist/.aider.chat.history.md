#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Given any two lists `A` and `B`, determine if:  
####   
#### - List `A` is equal to list `B`; or  
#### - List `A` contains list `B` (`A` is a superlist of `B`); or  
#### - List `A` is contained by list `B` (`A` is a sublist of `B`); or  
#### - None of the above is true, thus lists `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### Specifically, list `A` is equal to list `B` if both lists have the same values in the same order.  
#### List `A` is a superlist of `B` if `A` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `B`.  
#### List `A` is a sublist of `B` if `B` contains a sub-sequence of values equal to `A`.  
####   
#### Examples:  
####   
#### - If `A = []` and `B = []` (both lists are empty), then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = []`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = []` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4, 5]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [3, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` is a sublist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 2, 3]`, then `A` and `B` are equal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `B = [2, 3, 4]`, then `A` is a superlist of `B`  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 4]` and `B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
#### - If `A = [1, 2, 3]` and `B = [1, 3, 2]`, then `A` and `B` are unequal  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: sublist.h sublist.cpp  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the sublist comparison logic. We need to:

1. Add an enum to represent the comparison result
2. Create a compare function that checks list relationships
3. Add helper functions to check sublist/superlist conditions

Here are the changes:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#pragma once

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#pragma once

#include <vector>

namespace sublist {

enum class ListRelation {
    EQUAL,
    UNEQUAL,
    SUBLIST,
    SUPERLIST
};

ListRelation compare(const std::vector<int>& list_a, const std::vector<int>& list_b);

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sublist.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

}  // namespace sublist
=======
#include "sublist.h"

namespace sublist {

namespace {

bool is_sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    if (a.empty()) return true;
    if (b.size() < a.size()) return false;

    for (size_t i = 0; i <= b.size() - a.size(); ++i) {
        if (std::equal(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin() + i)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

} // anonymous namespace

ListRelation compare(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    if (a == b) {
        return ListRelation::EQUAL;
    }

    if (is_sublist(a, b)) {
        return ListRelation::SUBLIST;
    }

    if (is_sublist(b, a)) {
        return ListRelation::SUPERLIST;
    }

    return ListRelation::UNEQUAL;
}

}  // namespace sublist
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation:
1. `ListRelation` enum defines the 4 possible comparison outcomes
2. `compare()` first checks for equality, then checks sublist/superlist conditions
3. `is_sublist()` helper checks if one list is contained within another using:
   - Empty list is always a sublist
   - Check all possible starting positions in the larger list
   - Use std::equal to compare subsequences

This handles all the specified cases including empty lists and different-sized lists.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in sublist.h sublist.cpp to resolve the errors.  

The errors show two main issues to fix:
1. The enum is named `ListRelation` but should be `List_comparison`
2. The function is named `compare` but should be `sublist`

Here are the necessary changes:

sublist.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
enum class ListRelation {
    EQUAL,
    UNEQUAL,
    SUBLIST,
    SUPERLIST
};

ListRelation compare(const std::vector<int>& list_a, const std::vector<int>& list_b);
=======
enum class List_comparison {
    equal,
    unequal,
    sublist,
    superlist
};

List_comparison sublist(const std::vector<int>& list_a, const std::vector<int>& list_b);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sublist.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
ListRelation compare(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    if (a == b) {
        return ListRelation::EQUAL;
    }

    if (is_sublist(a, b)) {
        return ListRelation::SUBLIST;
    }

    if (is_sublist(b, a)) {
        return ListRelation::SUPERLIST;
    }

    return ListRelation::UNEQUAL;
=======
List_comparison sublist(const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
    if (a == b) {
        return List_comparison::equal;
    }

    if (is_sublist(a, b)) {
        return List_comparison::sublist;
    }

    if (is_sublist(b, a)) {
        return List_comparison::superlist;
    }

    return List_comparison::unequal;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Rename the enum from `ListRelation` to `List_comparison`
2. Rename the comparison function from `compare` to `sublist`
3. Update all enum values to lowercase to match the test expectations
4. Update the return type of the function to match the renamed enum
