#### # Introduction  
####   
#### After years of filling out forms and waiting, you've finally acquired your banking license.  
#### This means you are now officially eligible to open your own bank, hurray!  
####   
#### Your first priority is to get the IT systems up and running.  
#### After a day of hard work, you can already open and close accounts, as well as handle withdrawals and deposits.  
####   
#### Since you couldn't be bothered writing tests, you invite some friends to help test the system.  
#### However, after just five minutes, one of your friends claims they've lost money!  
#### While you're confident your code is bug-free, you start looking through the logs to investigate.  
####   
#### Ah yes, just as you suspected, your friend is at fault!  
#### They shared their test credentials with another friend, and together they conspired to make deposits and withdrawals from the same account _in parallel_.  
#### Who would do such a thing?  
####   
#### While you argue that it's physically _impossible_ for someone to access their account in parallel, your friend smugly notifies you that the banking rules _require_ you to support this.  
#### Thus, no parallel banking support, no go-live signal.  
#### Sighing, you create a mental note to work on this tomorrow.  
#### This will set your launch date back at _least_ one more day, but well...  
#### # Instructions  
####   
#### Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.  
####   
#### As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), your bank software must allow accounts to be safely accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.  
#### For example, there may be many deposits and withdrawals occurring in parallel; you need to ensure there are no [race conditions][wikipedia] between when you read the account balance and set the new balance.  
####   
#### It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.  
####   
#### [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software  
####   
#### ####  
####   
#### Use the above instructions to modify the supplied files: bank_account.cpp bank_account.h  
#### Don't change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.  
#### Only use standard libraries, don't suggest installing any packages.  

I'll help implement the thread-safe bank account system using C++ standard library mutexes. We need to:

1. Add mutex and state tracking to the BankAccount class
2. Implement thread-safe operations with proper error checking
3. Add account closure functionality

Here are the necessary changes:

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {};  // class Bankaccount

}  // namespace Bankaccount

=======
#if !defined(BANK_ACCOUNT_H)
#define BANK_ACCOUNT_H

#include <mutex>
#include <stdexcept>

namespace Bankaccount {
class Bankaccount {
private:
    mutable std::mutex mtx;
    int balance{0};
    bool closed{false};

    void checkClosed() const {
        if (closed) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Account is closed");
        }
    }

public:
    void Deposit(int amount);
    void Withdraw(int amount);
    int Balance() const;
    void Close();
    
    // Constructor/destructor
    Bankaccount() = default;
    ~Bankaccount() = default;
    
    // Prevent copying/moving
    Bankaccount(const Bankaccount&) = delete;
    Bankaccount& operator=(const Bankaccount&) = delete;
};

}  // namespace Bankaccount

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {}
=======
#include "bank_account.h"

namespace Bankaccount {

void Bankaccount::Deposit(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    checkClosed();
    
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid deposit amount");
    }
    balance += amount;
}

void Bankaccount::Withdraw(int amount) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    checkClosed();
    
    if (amount <= 0) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Invalid withdrawal amount");
    }
    if (amount > balance) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Insufficient funds");
    }
    balance -= amount;
}

int Bankaccount::Balance() const {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    return balance;
}

void Bankaccount::Close() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (closed) return;
    closed = true;
    balance = 0;
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The implementation provides:
1. Thread safety using std::mutex and lock_guard
2. Atomic operations that prevent race conditions
3. Proper error checking for invalid operations
4. Account closure functionality
5. Prevention of copying/moving accounts
6. Proper cleanup when closing accounts
7. Exception-based error reporting for invalid operations

All operations will:
- Fail immediately if the account is closed
- Validate input parameters
- Maintain consistent state across threads
- Prevent double-closing
- Ensure balance integrity during concurrent operations

The code uses only standard C++ headers (mutex, stdexcept) and follows RAII principles for lock management.

#### See the testing errors above.  
#### The tests are correct, don't try and change them.  
#### Fix the code in bank_account.cpp bank_account.h to resolve the errors.  

The test errors show mismatches between the method names in our code and the tests. The tests use lowercase method names (open/close/deposit/withdraw/balance) while our implementation uses uppercase. Let's fix this naming mismatch and add the missing open() method.

bank_account.h
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    void Deposit(int amount);
    void Withdraw(int amount);
    int Balance() const;
    void Close();
=======
    void deposit(int amount);
    void withdraw(int amount);
    int balance() const;
    void close();
    void open();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::Deposit(int amount) {
=======
void Bankaccount::deposit(int amount) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::Withdraw(int amount) {
=======
void Bankaccount::withdraw(int amount) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
int Bankaccount::Balance() const {
=======
int Bankaccount::balance() const {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
void Bankaccount::Close() {
=======
void Bankaccount::close() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

bank_account.cpp
```cpp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}  // namespace Bankaccount
=======
void Bankaccount::open() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (closed) {
        closed = false;
    }
}

}  // namespace Bankaccount
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Rename all methods to lowercase to match test expectations
2. Add the missing open() method to reopen closed accounts
3. Maintain thread safety with the existing mutex pattern
4. Keep the same error checking and validation logic

The open() method follows the same thread-safe pattern as other methods and allows reopening a closed account while maintaining the existing balance (though tests appear to reset it - we follow the error message guidance that "tests are correct" and assume they handle this).
